\page PROFILERES Profiling Results
The following profiling results were obtained using an ATMega328p @ 16MHz.
The test cases are designed to make use of the kernel profiler, which accurately
measures the performance of the fundamental system APIs, in order to provide 
information for user comparison, as well as to ensure that regressions are not
being introduced into the system.
