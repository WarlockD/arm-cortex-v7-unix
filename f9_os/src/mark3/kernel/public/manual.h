    The Mark3 Realtime Kernel is a completely free, open-source, real-time operating
    system aimed at bringing powerful, easy-to-use multitasking to microcontroller
    systems without MMUs.

    It uses modern programming languages and concepts to minimize code duplication,
    and its object-oriented design enhances readibility. The API is simple – in six
    function calls, you can set up the kernel, initialize two threads, and start the
    scheduler.

    The source is fully-documented with example code provided to illustrate concepts.
    The result is a performant RTOS, which is easy to read, easy to understand, and
    easy to extend to fit your needs.

    But Mark3 is bigger than just a real-time kernel, it also contains a number
    of class-leading features:

    - Native implementation in C++, with C-language bindings.
    - Device driver HAL which provides a meaningful abstraction around device-specific
      peripherals.
    - Capable recursive-make driven build system which can be used to build all
      libraries, examples, tests, documentation, and user-projects for any number of
      targets from the command-line.
    - Graphics and UI code designed to simplify the implementation of systems using
      displays, keypads, joysticks, and touchscreens
    - Standards-based custom communications protocol used to simplify the creation
      of host tools
    - A bulletproof, well-documented bootloader for AVR microcontrollers
      Support for kernel-aware simulators, incluing Funkenstein's own flAVR.

    \page CONFIG0 Configuring The Mark3 Kernel

    \section CONFIG_I Overview

    The Mark3 Kernel features a large number of compile-time options that can
    be set by the user.  In this way, the user can build a custom OS kernel that
    provides only the necessary feature set required by the application, and
    reduce the code and data requirements of the kernel.

    Care has been taken to ensure that all valid combinations of features can be
    enabled or disabled, barring direct dependencies.

    When Mark3 is built, the various compile-time definitions are used to alter
    how the kernel is compiled, and include or exclude various bits and pieces
    in order to satisfy the requirements of the selected features.  As a result,
    the kernel must be rebuilt whenever changes are made to the configuration
    header.

    Note that not all demos, libraries, and tests will build successfully if the
    prerequisite features are not included.

    Kernel options are set by modifying mark3cfg.h, located within the
    /kernel/public folder.

    In the following sections, we will discuss the various configuration options,
    grouped by functionality.

    \section CONFIG_T Timer Options

    <b>KERNEL_USE_TIMERS</b>

    This option is related to all kernel time-tracking:
    - Timers provide a way for events to be periodically triggered in a
     lightweight manner.  These can be periodic, or one-shot.
    - Thread Quantum (usedd for round-robin scheduling) is dependent on this
     module, as is Thread Sleep functionality.
    .

    Setting this option to 0 disables all timer-based functionality within the
    kernel.

    <b>KERNEL_TIMERS_TICKLESS</b>

    If you've opted to use the kernel timers module, you have an option
    as to which timer implementation to use:  Tick-based or Tick-less.

    Tick-based timers provide a "traditional" RTOS timer implementation
    based on a fixed-frequency timer interrupt.  While this provides
    very accurate, reliable timing, it also means that the CPU is being
    interrupted far more often than may be necessary (as not all timer
    ticks result in "real work" being done).

    Tick-less timers still rely on a hardware timer interrupt, but uses
    a dynamic expiry interval to ensure that the interrupt is only
    called when the next timer expires.  This increases the complexity
    of the timer interrupt handler, but reduces the number and frequency.

    Note that the CPU port (kerneltimer.cpp) must be implemented for the
    particular timer variant desired.

    Set this option to 1 to use the tickless timer implementation, 0 to use
    the traditional tick-based approach.  Tickless timers are a bit more heavy
    weight (larger code footprint), but can yield significant power savings as
    the CPU does not need to wake up at a fixed, high frequency.

    <b>KERNEL_USE_TIMEOUTS</b>

    By default, if you opt to enable kernel timers, you also get timeout-
    enabled versions of the blocking object APIs along with it.  This
    support comes at a small cost to code size, but a slightly larger cost
    to realtime performance - as checking for the use of timers in the
    underlying internal code costs some cycles.

    As a result, the option is given to the user here to manually disable
    these timeout-based APIs if desired by the user for performance and
    code-size reasons.

    Set this option to 1 to enable timeout-based APIs for blocking calls.

    <b>KERNEL_USE_QUANTUM</b>

    Do you want to enable time quanta?  This is useful when you want to have
    tasks in the same priority group share time in a controlled way.  This
    allows equal tasks to use unequal amounts of the CPU, which is a great
    way to set up CPU budgets per thread in a round-robin scheduling system.
    If enabled, you can specify a number of ticks that serves as the default
    time period (quantum).  Unless otherwise specified, every thread in a
    priority will get the default quantum.

    Set this option to 1 to enable round-robin scheduling.

    <b>THREAD_QUANTUM_DEFAULT</b>

    This value defines the default thread quantum when KERNEL_USE_QUANTUM is
    enabled.  The value defined is a time in milliseconds.

    <b>KERNEL_USE_SLEEP</b>

    This define enables the Thread::Sleep() API, which allows a thread to
    suspend its operation for a defined length of time, specified in ms.

    \section CONFIG_BL Blocking Objects

    <b>KERNEL_USE_NOTIFY</b>

    This is a simple blocking object, where a thread (or threads) are guaranteed
    to block until an asynchronous event signals the object.

    <b>KERNEL_USE_SEMAPHORE</b>

    Do you want the ability to use counting/binary semaphores for thread
    synchronization?  Enabling this features provides fully-blocking semaphores
    and enables all API functions declared in semaphore.h.  If you have to
    pick one blocking mechanism, this is the one to choose.

    Note that all IPC mechanisms (mailboxes, messages) rely on semaphores, so
    keep in mind that this is a prerequisite for many other features in the
    kernel.

    <b>KERNEL_USE_MUTEX</b>

    Do you want the ability to use mutual exclusion semaphores (mutex) for
    resource/block protection?  Enabling this feature provides mutexes, with
    priority inheritence, as declared in mutex.h.

    <b>KERNEL_USE_EVENTFLAG</b>

    Provides additional event-flag based blocking.  This relies on an
    additional per-thread flag-mask to be allocated, which adds 2 bytes
    to the size of each thread object.

    \section CONFIG_IPC Inter-process/thread Communication

    <b>KERNEL_USE_MESSAGE</b>

    Enable inter-thread messaging using message queues.  This is the preferred
    mechanism for IPC for serious multi-threaded communications; generally
    anywhere a semaphore or event-flag is insufficient.

    <b>GLOBAL_MESSAGE_POOL_SIZE</b>

    If Messages are enabled, define the size of the default kernel message
    pool.  Messages can be manually added to the message pool, but this
    mechansims is more convenient and automatic.   All message queues can
    share their message objects from this global pool to maximize efficiency
    and simplify data management.

    <b>KERNEL_USE_MAILBOX</b>

    Enable inter-thread messaging using mailboxes.  A mailbox manages a blob
    of data provided by the user, that is partitioned into fixed-size blocks
    called envelopes.  The size of an envelope is set by the user when the
    mailbox is initialized.  Any number of threads can read-from and write-to
    the mailbox.  Envelopes can be sent-to or received-from the mailbox at
    the head or tail.  In this way, mailboxes essentially act as a circular
    buffer that can be used as a blocking FIFO or LIFO queue.

    \section CONFIG_DBG Debug Features

    <b>KERNEL_USE_THREADNAME</b>

    Provide Thread method to allow the user to set a name for each
    thread in the system.  Adds a const char* pointer to the size
    of the thread object.

    <b>KERNEL_USE_DEBUG</b>

    Provides extra logic for kernel debugging, and instruments the kernel
    with extra asserts, and kernel trace functionality.

    <b>KERNEL_ENABLE_LOGGING</b>

    Set this to 1 to enable very chatty kernel logging.  Since most
    important things in the kernel emit logs, a large log-buffer and
    fast output are required in order to keep up.  This is a pretty
    advanced power-user type feature, so it's disabled by default.

    <b>KERNEL_ENABLE_USER_LOGGING</b>

    This enables a set of logging macros similar to the kernel-logging
    macros; however, these can be enabled or disabled independently.
    This allows for user-code to benefit from the built-in kernel
    logging macros without having to account for the super-high-volume
    of logs generated by kernel code.

    \section CONFIG_KRN Enhancements, Security, Miscellaneous

    <b>KERNEL_USE_DRIVER</b>

    Enabling device drivers provides a posix-like filesystem interface for
    peripheral device drivers.

    <b>KERNEL_USE_DYNAMIC_THREADS</b>

    Provide extra Thread methods to allow the application to create
    (and more importantly destroy) threads at runtime.  useful for
    designs implementing worker threads, or threads that can be restarted
    after encountering error conditions.

    <b>KERNEL_USE_PROFILER</b>

    Provides extra classes for profiling the performance of code.  useful
    for debugging and development, but uses an additional hardware timer.

    <b>KERNEL_USE_ATOMIC</b>

    Provides support for atomic operations, including addition, subtraction,
    set, and test-and-set.  Add/Sub/Set contain 8, 16, and 32-bit variants.

    <b>SAFE_UNLINK</b>

    "Safe unlinking" performs extra checks on data to make sure that there
    are no consistencies when performing operations on linked lists.  This
    goes beyond pointer checks, adding a layer of structural and metadata
    validation to help detect system corruption early.

    <b>KERNEL_AWARE_SIMULATION</b>

    Include support for kernel-aware simulation.  Enabling this feature
    adds advanced profiling, trace, and environment-aware debugging and
    diagnostic functionality when Mark3-based applications are run on the
    flAVR AVR simulator.

    <b>KERNEL_USE_IDLE_FUNC</b>

    Enabling this feature removes the necessity for the user to dedicate
    a complete thread for idle functionality.  This saves a full thread
    stack, but also requires a bit extra static data.  This also adds a
    slight overhead to the context switch and scheduler, as a special case
    has to be taken into account.

    <b>KERNEL_USE_AUTO_ALLOC</b>

    This feature enables an additional set of APIs that allow for objects
    to be created on-the-fly out of a special heap, without having to
    explicitly allocate them (from stack, heap, or static memory). Note
    that auto-alloc memory cannot be reclaimed.

    <b>AUTO_ALLOC_SIZE</b>

    Size (in bytes) of the static pool of memory reserved from RAM for use by
    the auto allocator (if enabled).

    \page BUILD0 Building Mark3

    Mark3 is distributed with a recursive makefile build system, allowing
    the entire source tree to be built into a series of libraries with
    simple make commands. The way the scripts work, every directory with a
    valid makefile is scanned, as well as all of its subdirectories. The
    build then generates binary components for all of the components it
    finds -libraries and executables. All libraries that are generated can
    then be imported into an application using the linker without having to
    copy-and-paste files on a module-by-module basis. Applications built
    during this process can then be loaded onto a device directly, without
    requiring a GUI-based IDE. As a result, Mark3 integrates well with 3rd
    party tools for continuous-integration and automated testing.

    This modular framework allows for large volumes of libraries and binaries
    to be built at once - the default build script leverages this to build all
    of the examples and unit tests at once,	linking against the pre-built
    kernel, services, and drivers.  Whatever can be built as a library is
    built as a library, promoting reuse throughout the platform, and enabling
    Mark3 to be used as a platform, with an ecosystem of libraries, services,
    drivers and applications.

    \section BUILDLAYOUT Source Layout

    One key aspect of Mark3 is that system features are organized into
    their own separate modules. These modules are further grouped
    together into folders based on the type of features represented:

    \verbatim
    Root         Base folder, contains recursive makefiles for build system
      arduino      Arduino-specific headers and API documentation files
      bootloader   Mark3 Bootloader code for AVR microcontrollers
      build        Makefiles and device-configuraton data for various platforms
      docs         Documentation (including this)
      drivers      Device driver code for various supported devices

      tests        Unit tests, written as C/C++ applications
      util         .net-based font converter, terminal, programmer, config util
    \endverbatim

    \section BUILDKERNEL Building the kernel

	There are 3 main components of the recursive makefile system used to build
	Mark3 and its associated middleware libraries and examples.  The components
	are the files "base.mak", "platform.mak", and "build.mak"

    The base.mak file determines how the kernel, drivers, and libraries are
    built, for what targets, and with what options.  These options are set as 
	variables that are included in a "platform.mak" file for your target, 
	located under the /builds directory.  "platform.mak" is included for all
	build steps, and is the place where all chip/board-specific toolchain
	configuration takes place.

    Build.mak contains the base logic which is used to perform a recursive make
    in all project directories. Unless you really know what you're doing, it's best
    to leave this as-is.

	Beyond the essential makefiles, the build system uses a series of environment
	variables to configure a recursive make-based build system appropriately for
	a given target part and	toolchain.

    Below is an overview of the main variables used to configure the build.

    \verbatim
    STAGE 		- Location in the filesystem where the build output is stored
    ROOT_DIR 	- The location of the root source tree
    ARCH		- The CPU architecture to build against
    VARIANT		- The variant of the above CPU to target
    TOOLCHAIN	- Which toolchain to build with (dependent on ARCH and VARIANT)
    \endverbatim

    You must make sure that all required toolchain paths are set in your system
    environment variables so that they are accessible directly through from the
    command-line

	Once a sane environment has been created, the kernel, libraries, 
	examples and tests can be built by running ./scripts/build.sh from the root
	directory.  By default, Mark3 builds for the atmega328p target, but the target
	can be selected by manually configuring the above environment variables, or by
	running the included ./scripts/set_target.sh script as follows:

	\verbatim	
	. ./scripts/set_target.sh <architecture> <variant> <toolchain>
	\endverbatim

	Where: 
	\verbatim
	 <architecture> is the target CPU architecture(i.e. avr, msp430, cm0, cm3, cm4f)
	 <variant>		is the part name (i.e. atmega328p, msp430f2274, generic)
	 <toolchain>	is the build toolchain (i.e. gcc)
	\endverbatim

    Once configured, you can build the source tree using the various make targets:

    - make headers
      - copy all headers in each module's /public subdirectory to the location specified by STAGE environment variable's ./inc subdirectory.
      .
    - make library
      - regenerate all objects copy marked as libraries (i.e. the kernel + drivers).  Resulting binaries are copied into STAGE's ./lib subdirectory.
      .
    - make binary
      - build all executable projects in the root directory structure.  In the default distribution, this includes the basic set of demos.
      .
    .

    These steps are chained together automatically as part of the build.sh
    script found under the /scripts subdirectory.  Running ./scripts/build.sh
    from the root of the embedded source directory will result in all headers
    being exported, libraries built, and applications built.  This script
    will also default to building for atmega328p using GCC if none of the
    required environment variables have previously been configured.

    To add new components to the recursive build system, simply add your
    code into a new folder beneath the root install location.

    Source files, the module makefile and private header files go directly
    in the new folder, while public headers are placed in a ./public
    subdirectory. Create a ./obj directory to hold the output from the
    builds.

    The contents of the module makefile looks something like this:

    \code

    # Include common prelude make file
    include $(ROOT_DIR)base.mak

    # If we're building a library, set IS_LIB and LIBNAME
    # If we're building an app, set IS_APP and APPNAME
    IS_LIB=1
    LIBNAME=mylib

    #this is the list of the source modules required to build the kernel
    CPP_SOURCE = mylib.cpp \
                 someotherfile.cpp

    # Similarly, C-language source would be under the C_SOURCE variable.

    # Include the rest of the script that is actually used for building the
    # outputs
    include $(ROOT_DIR)build.mak

    \endcode

    Once you've placed your code files in the right place, and configured
    the makefile appropriately, call the following sequence to guarantee
    that your code will be built.  

    \verbatim
    > make headers
    > make library
    > make binary
    \endverbatim

	Note that library or app-specific environment variables can be set (or modified
	from the defaults) from within the body of the makefile.  For example,
	the CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, and LFLAGS variables can be used to supply additional chip-
	specific toolchain flags.  The flags can be used to allow a user to reference
	chip-specific startup code, headers, middleware, or linker scripts that aren't
	part of the standard Mark3 distribution.

    \section WINBUILD Building on Windows

    Building Mark3 on Windows is the same as on Linux, but there are a few
    prerequisites that need to be taken into consideration before the
    build scripts and makefiles will work as expected.

	Below is an example of setting up the AVR toolchain on Windows:

    <b>Step 1 - Install Latest Atmel Studio IDE</b>

    Atmel Studio contains the AVR8 GCC toolchain, which contains the necessary
    compilers, assemblers, and platform support required to turn the source
    modules into libraries and executables.

    To get Atmel Studio, go to the Atmel website (http://www.atmel.com) and
    register to download the latest version.  This is a free download (and
    rather large).  The included IDE (if you choose to use it) is very slick,
    as it's based on Visual Studio, and contains a wonderful cycle-accurate
    simulator for AVR devices.  In fact, the simulator is so good that most
    of the kernel and its drivers were developed using this tool.

    Once you have downloaded and installed Atmel Studio, you will need to
    add the location of the AVR toolcahin to the PATH environment variable.

    To do this, go to Control Panel -> System and Security -> System ->
    Advanced System Settings, and edit the PATH variable.  Append the location
    of the toolchain bin folder to the end of the variable.

    On Windows x64, it should look something like this:

    \verbatim
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Atmel\Atmel Toolchain\AVR8 GCC\Native\3.4.2.1002\avr8-gnu-toolchain\bin
    \endverbatim

    <b>Step 2 - Install MinGW and MinSys</b>

    MinGW (and MinSys in particular) provide a unix-like environment that
    runs under windows.  Some of the utilities provided include a version of
    the bash shell, and GNU standard make - both which are required by
    the Mark3 recursive build system.

    The MinGW installer can be downloaded from its project page on SourceForge.
    When installing, be sure to select the "MinSys" component.

    Once installed, add the MinSys binary path to the PATH environment variable,
    in a similar fashion as with Atmel Studio in Step 1.

    <b>Step 3 - Setup Include Paths in Platform Makefile</b>

    The AVR header file path must be added to the "platform.mak" makefile for
    each AVR Target you are attempting to build for.  These files can be located
    under /embedded/build/avr/atmegaXXX/.  The path to the includes directory
    should be added to the end of the CFLAGS and CPPFLAGS variables, as shown
    in the following:

    \code

    TEST_INC="/c/Program Files (x86)/Atmel/Atmel Toolchain/AVR8 GCC/Native/3.4.2.1002/avr8-gnu-toolchain/include"
    CFLAGS += -I$(TEST_INC)
    CPPFLAGS += -I$(TEST_INC)

    \endcode

    <b>Step 4 - Build Mark3 using Bash</b>

    Launch a terminal to your Mark3 base directory, and cd into the "embedded" folder.
    You should now be able to build Mark3 by running "bash ./build.sh" from the
    command-line.

    Alternately, you can run bash itself, building Mark3 by running ./build.sh or the
    various make targets using the same synatx as documented previously.

    Note - building on Windows is *slow*.  This has a lot to do with how "make" performs
    under windows.  There are faster substitutes for make (such as cs-make) that
    are exponentially quicker, and approach the performance of make on Linux.
    Other mechanisms, such as running make with multiple concurrent jobs (i.e. "make -j4")
    also helps significantly, especially on systems with multicore CPUs.

    \section EXPORTSRC Exporting the kernel source

    While the build system is flexible enough to adapt to any toolchain, it may
    be desireable to integrate the Mark3 kernel and associated drivers/libraries
    into another build system.

    Mark3 provides a script (the aptly-named export.sh) which allow for the source
    for any supported port to be exported for this purpose.  This script will
    also generate appropriate doxygen documentation, and package the whole of it
    together in a zip file.  The files in the archive are placed in a "flat"
    heirarchy, and do not require any specific path structure to be maintained
    when imported into another build system.

    As a special feature, if the "arduino" AVR target is specified, additional
    pre-processing is done on the source to turn the standard Mark3 kernel into
    a library that can be imported directly into Arudino IDE.  This is also how

    \section START0 Kernel Setup

    This section details the process of defining threads, initializing the
    kernel, and adding threads to the scheduler.

    If you're at all familiar with real-time operating systems, then these
    setup and initialization steps should be familiar.  I've tried very hard
    to ensure that as much of the heavy lifting is hidden from the user, so
    that only the bare minimum of calls are required to get things started.

    The examples presented in this chapter are real, working examples taken
    from the ATmega328p port.

    First, you'll need to create the necessary data structures and functions
    for the threads:
     -# Create a Thread object for all of the "root" or "initial" tasks.
     -# Allocate stacks for each of the Threads
     -# Define an entry-point function for each Thread

    This is shown in the example code below:

    \code
    //---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #include "thread.h"
    #include "kernel.h"

    //1) Create a thread object for all of the "root" or "initial" tasks
    static Thread AppThread;
    static Thread IdleThread;

    //2) Allocate stacks for each thread
    #define STACK_SIZE_APP      (192)
    #define STACK_SIZE_IDLE     (128)

    static uint8_t aucAppStack[STACK_SIZE_APP];
    static uint8_t aucIdleStack[STACK_SIZE_IDLE];

    //3) Define entry point functions for each thread
    void AppThread(void);
    void IdleThread(void);

    \endcode

    Next, we'll need to add the required kernel initialization code to main.
    This consists of running the Kernel's init routine, initializing all of
    the threads we defined, adding the threads to the scheduler, and finally
    calling Kernel::Start(), which transfers control of the system to the
    RTOS.

    These steps are illustrated in the following example.

    \code

    int main(void)
    {
        //1) Initialize the kernel prior to use
        Kernel::Init();				// MUST be before other kernel ops

        //2) Initialize all of the threads we've defined
        AppThread.Init(	aucAppStack,		// Pointer to the stack
                        STACK_SIZE_APP,		// Size of the stack
                        1,			// Thread priority
                        (void*)AppEntry,	// Entry function
                        NULL );         	// Entry function argument

        IdleThread.Init( aucIdleStack,		// Pointer to the stack
                         STACK_SIZE_IDLE,	// Size of the stack
                         0,			// Thread priority
                         (void*)IdleEntry,	// Entry function
                         NULL );		// Entry function argument

        //3) Add the threads to the scheduler
        AppThread.Start();			// Actively schedule the threads
        IdleThread.Start();

        //4) Give control of the system to the kernel
        Kernel::Start();			// Start the kernel!
    }
    \endcode

    Not much to it, is there?
    There are a few noteworthy points in this code, though.

    In order for the kernel to work properly, a system must always contain
    an idle thread; that is, a thread at priority level 0 that never
    blocks.  This thread is responsible for performing any of the low-level
    power management on the CPU in order to maximize battery life in an
    embedded device.  The idle thread must also never block, and it
    must never exit.  Either of these operations will cause undefined
    behavior in the system.

    The App thread is at a priority level greater-than 0.  This ensures that
    as long as the App thread has something useful to do, it will be given
    control of the CPU.  In this case, if the app thread blocks, control
    will be given back to the Idle thread, which will put the CPU into
    a power-saving mode until an interrupt occurs.

    Stack sizes must be large enough to accommodate not only the requirements
    of the threads, but also the requirements of interrupts - up to the
    maximum interrupt-nesting level used.  Stack overflows are super-easy
    to run into in an embedded system; if you encounter strange and
    unexplained behavior in your code, chances are good that one of your
    threads is blowing its stack.

    \section THREADS Threads

    Mark3 Threads act as independent tasks in the system.  While they share
    the same address-space, global data, device-drivers, and system
    peripherals, each thread has its own set of CPU registers and stack,
    collectively known as the thread's <b>context</b>.  The context
    is what allows the RTOS kernel to rapidly switch between threads
    at a high rate, giving the illusion that multiple things are happening
    in a system, when really, only one thread is executing at a time.

    \subsection TH_SETUP Thread Setup

    Each instance of the Thread class represents a thread, its stack,
    its CPU context, and all of the state and metadata maintained by the
    kernel.  Before a Thread will be scheduled to run, it must first be
    initialized with the necessary configuration data.

    The Init function gives the user the opportunity to set the stack,
    stack size, thread priority, entry-point function, entry-function
    argument, and round-robin time quantum:

    Thread stacks are pointers to blobs of memory (usually char arrays)
    carved out of the system's address space.  Each thread must have a
    stack defined that's large enough to handle not only the requirements
    of local variables in the thread's code path, but also the maximum
    depth of the ISR stack.

    Priorities should be chosen carefully such that the shortest tasks
    with the most strict determinism requirements are executed first -
    and are thus located in the highest priorities.  Tasks that take the
    longest to execute (and require the least degree of responsiveness)
    must occupy the lower thread priorities.  The idle thread must be
    the only thread occupying the lowest priority level.

    The thread quantum only aplies when there are multiple threads in
    the ready queue at the same priority level.  This interval is used
    to kick-off a timer that will cycle execution between the threads
    in the priority list so that they each get a fair chance to execute.

    The entry function is the function that the kernel calls first when
    the thread instance is first started.  Entry functions have at most
    one argument - a pointer to a data-object specified by the user
    during initialization.

    An example thread initailization is shown below:

    \code
    Thread clMyThread;
    uint8_t aucStack[192];

    void AppEntry(void)
    {
        while(1)
        {
            // Do something!
        }
    }

    ...
    {
        clMyThread.Init(aucStack,	 // Pointer to the stack to use by this thread
                        192,	      	 // Size of the stack in bytes
                        1,		 // Thread priority (0 = idle, 7 = max)
                        (void*)AppEntry, // Function where the thread starts executing
                        NULL );          // Argument passed into the entry function

    }

    \endcode

    Once a thread has been initialized, it can be added to the scheduler by calling:

    \code

    clMyThread.Start();

    \endcode

    The thread will be placed into the Scheduler's queue at the designated
    priority, where it will wait its turn for execution.

    \subsection TH_ENTRY Entry Functions

    Mark3 Threads should not run-to-completion - they should execute as
    infinite loops that perform a series of tasks, appropriately partitioned
    to provide the responsiveness characteristics desired in the system.

    The most basic Thread loop is shown below:

    \code

    void Thread( void *param )
    {
        while(1)
        {
            // Do Something
        }
    }

    \endcode

    Threads can interact with eachother in the system by means of
    synchronization objects (Semaphore), mutual-exclusion objects (Mutex),
    Inter-process messaging (MessageQueue), and timers (Timer).

    Threads can suspend their own execution for a predetermined period of
    time by using the static Thread::Sleep() method.  Calling this will
    block the Thread's executin until the amount of time specified has
    ellapsed.  Upon expiry, the thread will be placed back into the ready
    queue for its priority level, where it awaits its next turn to run.

    \section TIMERS Timers

    Timer objects are used to trigger callback events periodic or on a one-shot
    (alarm) basis.

    While extremely simple to use, they provide one of the most powerful
    execution contexts in the system.  The timer callbacks execute from within
    the timer callback ISR in an interrupt-enabled context.  As such,
    timer callbacks are considered higher-priority than any thread in the system,
    but lower priority than other interrupts.  Care must be taken to ensure
    that timer callbacks execute as quickly as possible to minimize the
    impact of processing on the throughput of tasks in the system.
    Wherever possible, heavy-lifting should be deferred to the threads
    by way of semaphores or messages.

    Below is an example showing how to start a periodic system timer
    which will trigger every second:

    \code
    {
        Timer clTimer;
        clTimer.Init();

        clTimer.Start( 1000,              //!< Time in ms to use as the interval
                     1,                   //!< 1 = repeat, 0 = one-shot
                     MyCallback,          //!< Function that gets called on expiry
                     (void*)&my_data );   //!< Data passed to the timer callback

        ... // Keep doing work in the thread
    }

    // Callback function, executed from the timer-expiry context.
    void MyCallBack( Thread *pclOwner_, void *pvData_ )
    {
        LED.Flash(); // Flash an LED.
    }

    \endcode

    \section SEM Semaphores

    Semaphores are used to synchronized execution of threads based on the
    availability (and quantity) of application-specific resources in the
    system.  They are extremely useful for solving producer-consumer
    problems, and are the method-of-choice for creating efficient, low
    latency systems, where ISRs post semaphores that are handled
    from within the context of individual threads.  (Yes, Semaphores
    can be posted - but not pended - from the interrupt context).

    The following is an example of the producer-consumer usage of a binary
    semaphore:

    \code

    Semaphore clSemaphore; // Declare a semaphore shared between a producer and a consumer thread.

    void Producer()
    {
        clSemaphore.Init(0, 1);  //!< Intialize as a binary semaphore, with an initial value of 0, maximum value of 1.
        while(1)
        {
            // Do some work, create something to be consumed

            // Post a semaphore, allowing another thread to consume the data
            clSemaphore.Post();
        }
    }

    void Consumer()
    {
        // Assumes semaphore initialized before use...
        While(1)
        {
            // Wait for new data from the producer thread
            clSemaphore.Pend();

            // Consume the data!
        }
    }
    \endcode

    And an example of using semaphores from the ISR context to perform event-
    driven processing.

    \code

    Semaphore clSemaphore;

    __interrupt__ MyISR()
    {
        clSemaphore.Post(); // Post the interrupt.  Lightweight when uncontested.
    }

    void MyThread()
    {
        clSemaphore.Init(0, 1); // Ensure this is initialized before the MyISR interrupt is enabled.
        while(1)
        {
            // Wait until we get notification from the interrupt
            clSemaphore.Pend();

            // Interrupt has fired, do the necessary work in this thread's context
            HeavyLifting();
        }
    }

    \endcode

    \section MUT Mutexes

    Mutexes (Mutual exclusion objects) are provided as a means of creating
    "protected sections" around a particular resource, allowing for access
    of these objects to be serialized. Only one thread can hold the mutex at
    a time - other threads have to wait until the region is released by the
    owner thread before they can take their turn operating on the protected
    resource. Note that mutexes can only be owned by threads - they are not
    available to other contexts (i.e. interrupts). Calling the mutex APIs
    from an interrupt will cause catastrophic system failures.

    Note that these objects are also not recursive- that is, the owner
    thread can not attempt to claim a mutex more than once.

    Prioritiy inheritence is provided with these objects as a means to
    avoid prioritiy inversions. Whenever a thread at a priority than the
    mutex owner blocks on a mutex, the priority of the current thread is
    boosted to the highest-priority waiter to ensure that other tasks at
    intermediate priorities cannot artificically prevent progress from being
    made.

    Mutex objects are very easy to use, as there are only three operations
    supported: Initialize, Claim and Release. An example is shown below.

    \code

    Mutex clMutex;	// Create a mutex globally.

    void Init()
    {
        // Initialize the mutex before use.
        clMutex.Init();
    }

    // Some function called from a thread
    void Thread1Function()
    {
        clMutex.Claim();

        // Once the mutex is owned, no other thread can
        // enter a block protect by the same mutex

        my_protected_resource.do_something();
        my_protected_resource.do_something_else();

        clMutex.Release();
    }

    // Some function called from another thread
    void Thread2Function()
    {
        clMutex.Claim();

        // Once the mutex is owned, no other thread can
        // enter a block protect by the same mutex

        my_protected_resource.do_something();
        my_protected_resource.do_different_things();

        clMutex.Release();
    }

    \endcode

    \section EVF Event Flags

    Event Flags are another synchronization object, conceptually similar
    to a semaphore.

    Unlike a semaphore, however, the condition on which threads are unblocked
    is determined by a more complex set of rules.  Each Event Flag object
    contains a 16-bit field, and threads block, waiting for combinations of
    bits within this field to become set.

    A thread can wait on any pattern of bits from this field to be set, and
    any number of threads can wait on any number of different patterns.  Threads
    can wait on a single bit, multiple bits, or bits from within a subset of
    bits within the field.

    As a result, setting a single value in the flag can result in any number of
    threads becoming unblocked simultaneously.  This mechanism is extremely
    powerful, allowing for all sorts of complex, yet efficient, thread
    synchronization schemes that can be created using a single shared object.

    Note that Event Flags can be set from interrupts, but you cannot wait on
    an event flag from within an interrupt.

    Examples demonstrating the use of event flags are shown below.

    \code

        // Simple example showing a thread blocking on a multiple bits in the
        // fields within an event flag.

        EventFlag clEventFlag;

        int main()
        {
            ...
            clEventFlag.Init(); // Initialize event flag prior to use
            ...
        }

        void MyInterrupt()
        {
            // Some interrupt corresponds to event 0x0020
            clEventFlag.Set(0x0020);
        }

        void MyThreadFunc()
        {
            ...
            while(1)
            {
                ...
                uint16_t u16WakeCondition;

                // Allow this thread to block on multiple flags
                u16WakeCondition = clEventFlag.Wait(0x00FF, EVENT_FLAG_ANY);

                // Clear the event condition that caused the thread to wake (in this case,
                // u16WakeCondtion will equal 0x20 when triggered from the interrupt above)
                clEventFlag.Clear(u16WakeCondition);

                // <do something>
            }
        }

    \endcode

    \section MSG Messages

    Sending messages between threads is the key means of synchronizing
    access to data, and the primary mechanism to perform asynchronous data
    processing operations.

    Sending a message consists of the following operations:

    - Obtain a Message object from the global message pool
    - Set the message data and event fields
    - Send the message to the destination message queue
    .

    While receiving a message consists of the following steps:

    - Wait for a messages in the destination message queue
    - Process the message data
    - Return the message back to the global message pool
    .

    These operations, and the various data objects involved are discussed in
    more detail in the following section.

    \subsection MSGO Message Objects

    Message objects are used to communicate arbitrary data between threads
    in a safe and synchronous way.

    The message object consists of an event code field and a data field.
    The event code is used to provide context to the message object, while
    the data field (essentially a void * data pointer) is used to provide a
    payload of data corresponding to the particular event.

    Access to these fields is marshalled by accessors - the transmitting
    thread uses the SetData() and SetCode() methods to seed the data, while
    the receiving thread uses the GetData() and GetCode() methods to
    retrieve it.

    By providing the data as a void data pointer instead of a fixed-size
    message, we achieve an unprecedented measure of simplicity and
    flexibility. Data can be either statically or dynamically allocated, and
    sized appropriately for the event without having to format and reformat
    data by both sending and receiving threads. The choices here are left to
    the user - and the kernel doesn't get in the way of efficiency.

    It is worth noting that you can send messages to message queues from
    within ISR context.  This helps maintain consistency, since the same
    APIs can be used to provide event-driven programming facilities
    throughout the whole of the OS.

    \subsection MSGP Global Message Pool

    To maintain efficiency in the messaging system (and to prevent
    over-allocation of data), a global pool of message objects is provided.
    The size of this message pool is specified in the implementation, and
    can be adjusted depending on the requirements of the target application
    as a compile-time option.

    Allocating a message from the message pool is as simple as calling the
    GlobalMessagePool::Pop() Method.

    Messages are returned back to the GlobalMessagePool::Push() method once
    the message contents are no longer required.

    One must be careful to ensure that discarded messages always are
    returned to the pool, otherwise a resource leak can occur, which may
    cripple the operating system's ability to pass data between threads.

    \subsection MSGQ Message Queues

    Message objects specify data with context, but do not specify where the
    messages will be sent. For this purpose we have a MessageQueue object.
    Sending an object to a message queue involves calling the
    MessageQueue::Send() method, passing in a pointer to the Message object
    as an argument.

    When a message is sent to the queue, the first thread blocked on the
    queue (as a result of calling the MessageQueue Receive() method) will
    wake up, with a pointer to the Message object returned.

    It's worth noting that multiple threads can block on the same message
    queue, providing a means for multiple threads to share work in parallel.

    \subsection MSGQS Messaging Example

    \code

    // Message queue object shared between threads
    MessageQueue clMsgQ;

    // Function that initializes the shared message queue
    void MsgQInit()
    {
        clMsgQ.Init();
    }

    // Function called by one thread to send message data to
    // another
    void TxMessage()
    {
        // Get a message, initialize its data
        Message *pclMesg = GlobalMessagePool::Pop();

        pclMesg->SetCode(0xAB);
        pclMesg->SetData((void*)some_data);

        // Send the data to the message queue
        clMsgQ.Send(pclMesg);
    }

    // Function called in the other thread to block until
    // a message is received in the message queue.
    void RxMessage()
    {
        Message *pclMesg;

        // Block until we have a message in the queue
        pclMesg = clMsgQ.Receive();

        // Do something with the data once the message is received
        pclMesg->GetCode();

        // Free the message once we're done with it.
        GlobalMessagePool::Push(pclMesg);
    }
    \endcode

    \section MBX Mailboxes

    Another form of IPC is provided by Mark3, in the form of Mailboxes and Envelopes.

    Mailboxes are similar to message queues in that they provide a synchronized interface
    by which data can be transmitted between threads.

    Where Message Queues rely on linked lists of lightweight message objects (containing
    only message code and a void* data-pointer), which are inherently abstract,
    Mailboxes use a dedicated blob of memory, which is carved up into fixed-size
    chunks called Envelopes (defined by the user), which are sent and received.  Unlike
    message queues, mailbox data is copied to and from the mailboxes dedicated pool.

    Mailboxes also differ in that they provide not only a blocking "receive" call, but
    also a blocking "send" call, providing the opportunity for threads to block on
    "mailbox full" as well as "mailbox empty" conditions.

    All send/receive APIs support an optional timeout parameter if the KERNEL_USE_TIMEOUTS
    option has been configured in mark3cfg.h

    \subsection MBXE Mailbox Example

    \code

    // Create a mailbox object, and define a buffer that will be used to store the
    // mailbox' envelopes.
    static Mailbox clMbox;
    static uint8_t aucMBoxBuffer[128];

    ...
    void InitMailbox(void)
    {
        // Initialize our mailbox, telling it to use our defined buffer for envelope
        // storage.  Pass in the size of the buffer, and set the size of each
        // envelope to 16 bytes.  This gives u16 a mailbox capacity of (128 / 16) = 8
        // envelopes.
        clMbox.Init((void*)aucMBoxBuffer, 128, 16);

    }

    ...
    void SendThread(void)
    {
        // Define a buffer that we'll eventually send to the
        // mailbox.  Note the size is the same as that of an
        // envelope.
        uint8_t aucTxBuf[16];

        while(1)
        {
            // Copy some data into aucTxBuf, a 16-byte buffer, the
            // same size as a mailbox envelope.
            ...

            // Deliver the envelope (our buffer) into the mailbox
            clMbox.Send((void*)aucTxBuf);
        }
    }

    ...
    void RecvThred(void)
    {
        uint8_t aucRxBuf[16];

        while(1)
        {
            // Wait until there's a message in our mailbox.  Once
            // there is a message, read it into our local buffer.
            cmMbox.Receive((void*)aucRxBuf);

            // Do something with the contents of aucRxBuf, which now
            // contains an envelope of data read from the mailbox.
            ...
        }
    }

    \endcode

    \section NTF Notification Objects

    Notification objects are the most lightweight of all blocking objects supplied
    by Mark3.

    using this blocking primative, one or more threads wait for the notification
    object to be signalled by code elsewhere in the system (i.e. another
    thread or interrupt).  Once the the notification has been signalled, all
    threads currently blocked on the object become unblocked.

    \subsection NTFE Notification Example

    \code

    static Notify clNotifier;

    ...
    void MyThread(void *unused_)
    {
        // Initialize our notification object before use
        clNotifier.Init();

        while (1)
        {
            // Wait until our thread has been notified that it
            // can wake up.
            clNotify.Wait();

            ...
            // Thread has woken up now -- do something!
        }
    }

    ...
    void SignalCallback(void)
    {
        // Something in the system (interrupt, thread event, IPC,
        // etc.,) has called this function.  As a result, we need
        // our other thread to wake up.  Call the Notify object's
        // Signal() method to wake the thread up.  Note that this
        // will have no effect if the thread is not presently
        // blocked.

        clNotify.Signal();
    }

    \endcode

    \section SLP Sleep

    There are instances where it may be necessary for a thread to poll a
    resource, or wait a specific amount of time before proceeding to operate
    on a peripheral or volatile piece of data.

    While the Timer object is generally a better choice for performing
    time-sensitive operations (and certainly a better choice for periodic
    operations), the Thread::Sleep() method provides a convenient (and
    efficient) mechanism that allows for a thread to suspend its execution
    for a specified interval.

    Note that when a thread is sleeping it is blocked, during which other
    threads can operate, or the system can enter its idle state.

    \code
    int GetPeripheralData();
    {
        int value;
        // The hardware manual for a peripheral specifies that
        // the "foo()" method will result in data being generated
        // that can be captured using the "bar()" method.
        // However, the value only becomes valid after 10ms

        peripheral.foo();
        Thread::Sleep(10);	// Wait 10ms for data to become valid
        value = peripheral.bar();
        return value;
    }
    \endcode

    \section RR Round-Robin Quantum

    Threads at the same thread priority are scheduled using a round-robin
    scheme.  Each thread is given a timeslice (which can be configured)
    of which it shares time amongst ready threads in the group.  Once
    a thread's timeslice has expired, the next thread in the priority
    group is chosen to run until its quantum has expired - the cycle
    continues over and over so long as each thread has work to be done.

    By default, the round-robin interval is set at 4ms.

    This value can be overridden by calling the thread's SetQuantum()
    with a new interval specified in milliseconds.

    \page WHYMARK3 Why Mark3?

    My first job after graduating from university in 2005 was with a small company
    that had a very old-school, low-budget philosophy when it came to software
    development. Every make-or-buy decision ended with "make" when it came to
    tools. It was the kind of environment where vendors cost us money, but manpower
    was free. In retrospect, we didn't have a ton of business during the time
    that I worked there, and that may have had something to do with the fact that
    we were constantly short on ready cash for things we could code ourselves.

    Early on, I asked why we didn't use industry-standard tools - like JTAG debuggers
    or IDEs. One senior engineer scoffed that debuggers were tools for wimps - and
    something that a good programmer should be able to do without. After all - we
    had serial ports, GPIOs, and a bi-color LED on our boards. Since these were
    built into the hardware, they didn't cost us a thing. We also had a single
    software "build" server that took 5 minutes to build a 32k binary on its best
    days, so when we had to debug code, it was a painful process of trial and error,
    with lots of Youtube between iterations. We complained that tens of thousands
    of dollars of productivity was being flushed away that could have been solved
    by implementing a proper build server - and while we eventually got our wish,
    it took far more time than it should have.

    Needless to say, software development was painful at that company. We made
    life hard on ourselves purely out of pride, and for the right to say that we
    walked "up-hills both ways through 3 feet of snow, everyday". Our code was
    tied ever-so-tightly to our hardware platform, and the system code was
    indistinguishable from the application. While we didn't use an RTOS, we had
    effectively implemented a 3-priority threading scheme using a carefully
    designed interrupt nesting scheme with event flags and a while(1) superloop
    running as a background thread. Nothing was abstracted, and the code was
    always optimized for the platform, presumably in an effort to save on code
    size and wasted cycles. I asked why we didn't use an RTOS in any of our systems
    and received dismissive scoffs - the overhead from thread switching and
    maintaining multiple threads could not be tolerated in our systems according
    to our chief engineers. In retrospect, our ad-hoc system was likely as large
    as my smallest kernel, and had just as much context switching (althrough it
    was hidden by the compiler).

    And every time a new iteration of our product was developed, the firmware took
    far too long to bring up, because the algorithms and data structures had to
    be re-tooled to work with the peripherals and sensors attached to the new
    boards. We worked very hard in an attempt to reinvent the wheel, all in the
    name of producing "efficient" code.

    Regardless, I learned a lot about embedded software development.

    Most important, I learned that good design is the key to good software; and
    good design doesn't have to come at a price. In all but the smallest of
    projects, the well-designed, well-abstracted code is not only more portable,
    but it's usually smaller, easier to read, and easier to reuse.

    Also, since we had all the time in the world to invest in developing our own
    tools, I gained a lot of experience building them, and making use of good,
    free PC tools that could be used to develop and debug a large portion of our
    code. I ended up writing PC-based device and peripheral simulators,
    state-machine frameworks, and abstractions for our horrible ad-hoc system
    code. At the end of the day, I had developed enough tools that I could solve
    a lot of our development problems without having to re-inventing the wheel
    at each turn. Gaining a background in how these tools worked gave me a better
    understanding of how to use them - making me more productive at the jobs that
    I've had since.

    I am convinced that designing good software takes honest effort up-front,
    and that good application code cannot be written unless it is based on a
    solid framework. Just as the wise man builds his house on rocks, and not on
    sand, wise developers write applications based on a well-defined platforms.
    And while you can probably build a house using nothing but a hammer and sheer
    will, you can certainly build one a lot faster with all the right tools.

    This conviction lead me to development my first RTOS kernel in 2009 - FunkOS.
    It is a small, yet surprisingly full-featured kernel. It has all the basics
    (semaphores, mutexes, round-robin and preemptive scheduling), and some pretty
    advanced features as well (device drivers and other middleware). However, it
    had two major problems - it doesn't scale well, and it doesn't support many
    devices.

    While I had modest success with this kernel (it has been featured on some
    blogs, and still gets around 125 downloads a month), it was nothing like the
    success of other RTOS kernels like uC/OS-II and FreeRTOS. To be honest, as a
    one-man show, I just don't have the resources to support all of the devices,
    toolchains, and evaluation boards that a real vendor can. I had never expected
    my kernel to compete with the likes of them, and I don't expect Mark3 to
    change the embedded landscape either.

    My main goal with Mark3 was to solve the technical shortfalls in the FunkOS
    kernel by applying my experience in kernel development. As a result, Mark3 is
    better than FunkOS in almost every way; it scales better, has lower interrupt
    latency, and is generally more thoughtfully designed (all at a small cost to
    code size).

    Another goal I had was to create something easy to understand, that could be
    documented and serve as a good introduction to RTOS kernel design. The end
    result of these goals is the kernel as presented in this book - a full source
    listing of a working OS kernel, with each module completely documented and
    explained in detail.

    Finally, I wanted to prove that a kernel written entirely in C++ could
    perform just as well as one written in C.  Mark3 is fully benchmarked and
    profiled – you can see exactly how much it costs to call certain APIs or
    include various features in the kernel.

    And in addition, the code is more readable and easier to understand as a
    result of making use of object-oriented concepts provided by C++.
    Applications are easier to write because common concepts are encapsulated
    into objects (Threads, Semaphores, Mutexes, etc.) with their own methods and
    data, as opposed to APIs which rely on lots of explicit pointer or
    handle-passing, type casting, and other operations that are typically
    considered "unsafe" or "advaned" topics in C.

    \page WHENRTOS When should you use an RTOS?

    \section WHENREAL The reality of system code

    System code can be defined as the program logic required to manage, synchronize,
    and schedule all of the resources (CPU time, memory, peripherals, etc.) used
    by the application running on the CPU.  And it's true that a significant
    portion of the code running on an embedded system will be system code.  No
    matter how simple a system is, whether or not this logic is embedded directly
    into the application (bare-metal system), or included as part of a well-defined
    stack on which an application is written (RTOS-based); system code is still
    present, and it comes with a cost.

    As an embedded systems is being designed, engineers have to decide which
    approach to take:  Bare-metal, or RTOS.  There are advantages and
    disadvantages to each – and a reasonable engineer should always perform a
    thorough analysis of the pros and cons of each - in the context of the given
    application - before choosing a path.

    The following figure demonstrates the differences between the architecture of
    a bare-metal system and RTOS based system at a high level:

    \image html Mark3_arch.png
    \image latex Mark3_arch.png "Arch" width=10cm

    As can be seen, the RTOS (And associated middleware + libraries) captures a
    certain fixed size.

    As a generalization, bare-metal systems typically have the advantage in that
    the system code overhead is small to start – but grows significantly as the
    application grows in complexity.  At a certain point, it becomes extremely
    difficult and error-prone to add more functionality to an application running
    on such a system.  There's a tipping point, where the cost of the code used
    to work-around the limitations of a bare-metal system outweigh the cost of a
    capable RTOS.  Bare-metal systems also generally take longer to implement,
    because the system code has to be written from scratch (or derived from
    existing code) for the application.  The resulting code also tend to be less
    portable, as it takes serious discipline to keep the system-specific elements
    of the code separated – in an RTOS-based system, once the kernel and drivers
    are ported, the application code is generally platform agnostic.

    Conversely, an RTOS-based system incurs a slightly higher fixed cost up-front,
    but scales infinitely better than a bare-metal system as application's
    complexity increases.  Using an RTOS for simple systems reduces application
    development time, but may cause an application not to fit into some extremely
    size-constrained microcontroller.  An RTOS can also cause the size of an
    application to grow more slowly relative to a bare-metal system – especially
    as a result of applying synchronization mechanisms and judicious IPC.  As a
    result, an RTOS makes it significantly easier to “go agile” with an
    application – iteratively adding features and functionality, without having
    to consider refactoring the underlying system at each turn.

    Some of these factors may be more important than others.  Requirements,
    specifications, schedules, chip-selection, and volume projections for a
    project should all be used to feed into the discussions to decide whether or
    to go bare-metal or RTOS as a result.

    Consider the following questions when making that decision:

    - What is the application?
    - How efficient is efficient enough?
    - How fast is fast enough?
    - How small is small enough?
    - How responsive is responsive enough?
    - How much code space/RAM/etc is available on the target system?
    - How much code space/RAM do I need for an RTOS?
    - How much code space/RAM do I think I'll need for my application?
    - How much time do I have to deliver my system?
    - How many units do we plan to sell?
    .

    \section WHENSUPER Superloops, and their limitations

    \subsection WHENSUPERINTRO Intro to Superloops

    Before we start taking a look at designing a real-time operating system, it's
    worthwhile taking a look through one of the most-common design patterns that
    developers use to manage task execution in bare-metal embedded systems -
    Superloops.

    Systems based on superloops favor the system control logic baked directly into
    the application code, usually under the guise of simplicity, or memory (code
    and RAM) efficiency. For simple systems, superloops can definitely get the
    job done. However, they have some serious limitations, and are not suitable
    for every kind of project. In a lot of cases you can squeak by using
    superloops - especially in extremely constrained systems, but in general they
    are not a solid basis for reusable, portable code.

    Nonetheless, a variety of examples are presented here- from the extremely
    simple, to cooperative and liimted-preemptive multitasking systems, all of
    which are examples are representative of real-world systems that I've either
    written the firmware for, or have seen in my experience.

    \subsection WHENSUPERSIMPLE The simplest loop

    Let's start with the simplest embedded system design possible - an infinite
    loop that performs a single task repeatedly:

    \code{.cpp}
    int main()
    {
        while(1)
        {
            Do_Something();
        }
    }
    \endcode

    Here, the code inside the loop will run a single function forever and ever.
    Not much to it, is there? But you might be surprised at just how much embedded
    system firmware is implemented using essentially the same mechanism - there
    isn't anything wrong with that, but it's just not that interesting.

    Despite its simplicity we can see the beginnings of some core OS concepts.
    Here, the while(1) statement can be logically seen as the he operating system
    kernel - this one control statement determines what tasks can run in the
    system, and defines the constraints that could modify their execution. But
    at the end of the day, that's a big part of what a kernel is - a mechanism
    that controls the execution of application code.

    The second concept here is the task. This is application code provided by the
    user to perform some useful purpose in a system. In this case Do_something()
    represents that task - it could be monitoring blood pressure, reading a
    sensor and writing its data to a terminal, or playing an MP3; anything you
    can think of for an embedded system to do. A simple round-robin multi-tasking
    system can be built off of this example by simply adding additional tasks in
    sequence in the main while-loop. Note that in this example the CPU is always
    busy running tasks - at no time is the CPU idle, meaning that it is likely
    burning a lot of power.

    While we conceptually have two separate pieces of code involved here (an
    operating system kernel and a set of running tasks), they are not logically
    separate. The OS code is indistinguishable from the application. It's like a
    single-celled organism - everything is crammed together within the walls of
    an indivisible unit; and specialized to perform its given function relying
    solely on instinct.

    \subsection WHENSUPERINTER Interrupt-Driven Super-loop

    In the previous example, we had a system without any way to control the
    execution of the task- it just runs forever. There's no way to control when
    the task can (or more importantly can't) run, which greatly limits the
    usefulness of the system. Say you only want your task to run every 100
    miliseconds - in the previous code, you have to add a hard-coded delay at the
    end of your task's execution to ensure your code runs only when it should.

    Fortunately, there is a much more elegant way to do this. In this example,
    we introduce the concept of the synchronization object. A Synchronization
    object is some data structure which works within the bounds of the operating
    system to tell tasks when they can run, and in many cases includes special
    data unique to the synchronization event.

    There are a whole family of synchronization objects, which we'll get into
    later. In this example, we make use of the simplest synchronization primitive
    - the global flag.

    With the addition of synchronization brings the addition of event-driven
    systems. If you're programming a microcontroller system, you generally have
    scores of peripherals available to you - timers, GPIOs, ADCs, UARTs, ethernet,
    USB, etc. All of which can be configured to provide a stimulus to your system
    by means of interrupts. This stimulus gives us the ability not only to program
    our micros to do_something(), but to do_something() if-and-only-if a
    corresponding trigger has occurred.

    The following concepts are shown in the example below:

    \code{.cpp}
    volatile K_BOOL something_to_do = false;

    __interrupt__ My_Interrupt_Source(void)
    {
        something_to_do = true;
    }

    int main()
    {
        while (1)
        {
            if (something_to_do)
            {
                Do_something();
                something_to_do = false;
            }
            else
            {
                Idle();
            }
        }
    }
    \endcode
    
    So there you have it - an event driven system which uses a global variable
    to synchronize the execution of our task based on the occurrence of an
    interrupt. It's still just a bare-metal, OS-baked-into-the-application system,
    but it's introduced a whole bunch of added complexity (and control!) into
    the system.

    The first thing to notice in the source is that the global variable,
    something_to_do, is used as a synchronization object. When an interrupt occurs
    from some external event, triggering the My_Interrupt_Source() ISR, program
    flow in main() is interrupted, the interrupt handler is run, and
    something_to_do is set to true, letting us know that when we get back to
    main(), that we should run our Do_something() task.

    Another new concept at play here is that of the idle function. In general,
    when running an event driven system, there are times when the CPU has no
    application tasks to run. In order to minimize power consumption, CPUs
    usually contain instructions or registers that can be set up to disable
    non-essential subsets of the system when there's nothing to do. In general,
    the sleeping system can be re-activated quickly as a result of an interrupt
    or other external stimulus, allowing normal processing to resume.

    Now, we could just call Do_something() from the interrupt itself - but that's
    generally not a great solution. In general, the more time we spend inside an
    interrupt, the more time we spend with at least some interrupts disabled. As
    a result, we end up with interrupt latency. Now, in this system, with only
    one interrupt source and only one task this might not be a big deal, but say
    that Do_something() takes several seconds to complete, and in that time
    several other interrupts occur from other sources. While executing in our
    long-running interrupt, no other interrupts can be processed - in many cases,
    if two interrupts of the same type occur before the first is processed, one
    of these interrupt events will be lost. This can be utterly disastrous in a
    real-time system and should be avoided at all costs. As a result, it's
    generally preferable to use synchronization objects whenever possible to
    defer processing outside of the ISR.

    Another OS concept that is implicitly introduced in this example is that of
    task priority. When an interrupt occurs, the normal execution of code in
    main() is preempted: control is swapped over to the ISR (which runs to
    completion), and then control is given back to main() where it left off. The
    very fact that interrupts take precedence over what's running shows that main
    is conceptually a "low-priority" task, and that all ISRs are "high-priority"
    tasks. In this example, our "high-priority" task is setting a variable to
    tell our "low-priority" task that it can do something useful. We will
    investigate the concept of task priority further in the next example.

    Preemption is another key principle in embedded systems. This is the notion
    that whatever the CPU is doing when an interrupt occurs, it should stop, cache
    its current state (referred to as its context), and allow the high-priority
    event to be processed. The context of the previous task is then restored its
    state before the interrupt, and resumes processing. We'll come back to
    preemption frequently, since the concept comes up frequently in RTOS-based systems.

    \subsection WHENSUPERCOOP Cooperative multi-tasking

    Our next example takes the previous example one step further by introducing
    cooperative multi-tasking:

    \code{.cpp}
    // Bitfield values used to represent three distinct tasks
    #define TASK_1_EVENT (0x01)
    #define TASK_2_EVENT (0x02)
    #define TASK_3_EVENT (0x04)

    volatile K_UCHAR event_flags = 0;

    // Interrupt sources used to trigger event execution

    __interrupt__  My_Interrupt_1(void)
    {
        event_flags |= TASK_1_EVENT;
    }

    __interrupt__ My_Interrupt_2(void)
    {
        event_flags |= TASK_2_EVENT;
    }

    __interrupt__ My_Interrupt_3(void)
    {
        event_flags |= TASK_3_EVENT;
    }

    // Main tasks
    int main(void)
    {
        while(1)
        {
            while(event_flags)
            {
                if( event_flags & TASK_1_EVENT)
                {
                    Do_Task_1();
                    event_flags &= ~TASK_1_EVENT;
                } else if( event_flags & TASK_2_EVENT) {
                    Do_Task_2();
                    event_flags &= ~TASK_2_EVENT;
                } else if( event_flags & TASK_3_EVENT) {
                    Do_Task_3();
                    event_flags &= ~TASK_3_EVENT;
                }
            }
            Idle();
        }
    }
    \endcode
    
    This system is very similar to what we had before - however the differences
    are worth discussing. First, we have stimulus from multiple interrupt sources:
    each ISR is responsible for setting a single bit in our global event flag,
    which is then used to control execution of individual tasks from within main().

    Next, we can see that tasks are explicitly given priorities inside the main
    loop based on the logic of the if/else if structure. As long as there is
    something set in the event flag, we will always try to execute Task1 first,
    and only when Task1 isn't set will we attempt to execute Task2, and then
    Task3. This added logic provides the notion of priority. However, because
    each of these tasks exist within the same context (they're just different
    functions called from our main control loop), we don't have the same notion
    of preemption that we have when dealing with interrupts.

    That means that even through we may be running Task2 and an event flag for
    Task1 is set by an interrupt, the CPU still has to finish processing Task2
    to completion before Task1 can be run. And that's why this kind of scheduling
    is referred to as cooperative multitasking: we can have as many tasks as we
    want, but unless they cooperate by means of returning back to main, the
    system can end up with high-priority tasks getting starved for CPU time by
    lower-priority, long-running tasks.

    This is one of the more popular Os-baked-into-the-application approaches, and
    is widely used in a variety of real-time embedded systems.

    \subsection WHENSUPERHYBRID Hybrid cooperative/preemptive multi-tasking

    The final variation on the superloop design utilizes software-triggered
    interrupts to simulate a hybrid cooperative/preemptive multitasking system.
    Consider the example code below.

    \code{.cpp}
    // Bitfields used to represent high-priority tasks.  Tasks in this group
    // can preempt tasks in the group below - but not eachother.
    #define HP_TASK_1(0x01)
    #define HP_TASK_2(0x02)

    volatile K_UCHAR hp_tasks = 0;

    // Bitfields used to represent low-priority tasks.

            }
            Idle();
        }
    }
    \endcode
    
    In this example, High_Priority_Tasks() can be triggered at any time as a
    result of a software interrupt (SWI),. When a high-priority event is set, the
    code that sets the event calls the SWI as well, which instantly preempts
    whatever is happening in main, switching to the high-priority interrupt
    handler. If the CPU is executing in an interrupt handler already, the current
    ISR completes, at which point control is given to the high priority interrupt
    handler.

    Once inside the HP ISR, all interrupts (except the software interrupt) are
    re-enabled, which allows this interrupt to be preempted by other interrupt
    sources, which is called interrupt nesting. As a result, we end up with two
    distinct execution contexts (main and HighPriorityTasks()), in which all tasks
    in the high-priority group are guaranteed to preempt main() tasks, and will
    run to completion before returning control back to tasks in main(). This is
    a very basic preemptive multitasking scenario, approximating a "real" RTOS
    system with two threads of different priorities.

    \section WHENPROB Problems with superloops

    As mentioned earlier, a lot of real-world systems are implemented using a
    superloop design; and while they are simple to understand due to the limited
    and obvious control logic involved, they are not without their problems.

    \subsection WHENPROBHIDDEN Hidden Costs

    It's difficult to calculate the overhead of the superloop and the code
    required to implement workarounds for blocking calls, scheduling, and
    preemption. There's a cost in both the logic used to implement workarounds
    (usually involving state machines), as well as a cost to maintainability
    that comes with breaking up into chunks based on execution time instead of
    logical operations. In moderate firmware systems, this size cost can exceed
    the overhead of a reasonably well-featured RTOS, and the deficit in
    maintainability is something that is measurable in terms of lost
    productivity through debugging and profiling.

    \subsection WHENPROBTIGHTLY Tightly-coupled code

    Because the control logic is integrated so closely with the application
    logic, a lot of care must be taken not to compromise the separation between
    application and system code. The timing loops, state machines, and
    architecture-specific control mechanisms used to avoid (or simulate)
    preemption can all contribute to the problem. As a result, a lot of superloop
    code ends up being difficult to port without effectively simulating or
    replicating the underlying system for which the application was written.
    Abstraction layers can mitigate the risks, but a lot of care should be taken
    to fully decouple the application code from the system code.

    \subsection WHENPROBBLOCK No blocking Calls

    In a super-loop environment, there's no such thing as a blocking call or
    blocking objects. Tasks cannot stop mid-execution for event-driven I/O from
    other contexts - they must always run to completion. If busy-waiting and
    polling are used as a substitute, it increases latency and wastes cycles. As
    a result, extra code complexity is often times necessary to work-around this
    lack of blocking objects, often times through implementing additional state
    machines. In a large enough system, the added overhead in code size and
    cycles can add up.

    \subsection WHENPROBDIFF Difficult to guarantee responsiveness

    Without multiple levels of priority, it may be difficult to guarantee a
    certain degree of real-time responsiveness without added profiling and
    tweaking. The latency of a given task in a priority-based cooperative
    multitasking system is the length of the longest task. Care must be taken to
    break tasks up into appropriate sized chunks in order to ensure that higher-
    priority tasks can run in a timely fashion - a manual process that must be
    repeated as new tasks are added in the system. Once again, this adds extra
    complexity that makes code larger, more difficult to understand and maintain
    due to the artificial subdivision of tasks into time-based components.

    \subsection WHENPROBLIM Limited preemption capability

    As shown in the example code, the way to gain preemption in a superloop is
    through the use of nested interrupts. While this isn't unwiedly for two
    levels of priority, adding more levels beyond this is becomes complicated.
    In this case, it becomes necessary to track interrupt nesting manually, and
    separate sets of tasks that can run within given priority loops - and
    deadlock becomes more difficult to avoid.

    \page CANRTOS Can you afford an RTOS?

    \section CANRTOSINTRO Intro
    
    Of course, since you're reading the manual for an RTOS that I've been
    developing over the course of the several years, you can guess that the
    conclusion that I draw.

    If your code is of any sort of non-trivial complexity (say, at least a few-
    thousand lines), then a more appropriate question would be "can you afford
    *not* to use an RTOS in your system?".

    In short, there are simply too many benefits of an RTOS to ignore, the most
    important being:

    Threading, along with priority and time-based scheduling
    Sophisticated synchronization objects and IPC
    Flexible, powerful Software Timers
    Ability to write more portable, decoupled code

    Sure, these features have a cost in code space and RAM, but from my experience
    the cost of trying to code around a lack of these features will cost you as
    much - if not more.  The results are often far less maintainable, error
    prone, and complex.  And that simply adds time and cost.  Real developers
    ship, and the RTOS is quickly becoming one of the standard tools that help
    keep developers shipping.

    One of the main arguments against using an RTOS in an embedded project is
    that the overhead incurred is too great to be justified. Concerns over
    "wasted" RAM caused by using multiple stacks, added CPU utilization, and the
    "large" code footprint from the kernel cause a large number of developers to
    shun using a preemptive RTOS, instead favoring a non-preemptive,
    application-specific solution.

    I believe that not only is the impact negligible in most cases, but that the
    benefits of writing an application with an RTOS can lead to savings around
    the board (code size, quality, reliability, and development time). While
    these other benefits provide the most compelling case for using an RTOS, they
    are far more challenging to demonstrate in a quantitative way, and are
    clearly documented in numerous industry-based case studies.

    While there is some overhead associated with an RTOS, the typical arguments
    are largely unfounded when an RTOS is correctly implemented in a system. By
    measuring the true overhead of a preemptive RTOS in a typical application,
    we will demonstrate that the impact to code space, RAM, and CPU usage is
    minimal, and indeed acceptable for a wide range of CPU targets.


    To illustrate just how little an RTOS impacts the size of an embedded
    software design we will look at a typical microcontroller project and analyze
    the various types of overhead associated with using a pre-emptive realtime
    kernel versus a similar non-preemptive event-based framework.

    RTOS overhead can be broken into three distinct areas:

    - Code space: The amount of code space eaten up by the kernel (static)
    - Memory overhead: The RAM associated wtih running the kernel and application
                       threads.
    - Runtime overhead: The CPU cycles required for the kernel's functionality
                       (primarily scheduling and thread switching)
    .

    While there are other notable reasons to include or avoid the use of an RTOS
    in certain applications (determinism, responsiveness, and interrupt latency
    among others), these are not considered in this discussion - as they are
    difficult to consider for the scope of our "canned" application.

    \section CANRTOSAPP Application description

    For the purpose of this comparison, we first create an application using the
    standard preemptive Mark3 kernel with 2 system threads running: A foreground
    thread and a background thread. This gives three total priority levels in
    the system - the interrupt level (high), and two application priority
    threads (medium and low), which is quite a common paradigm for microcontroller
    firmware designs. The foreground thread processes a variety of time-critical
    events at a fixed frequency, while the background thread processes lower
    priority, aperiodic events. When there are no background thread events to
    process, the processor enters its low-power mode until the next interrupt is
    acknowledged.

    The contents of the threads themselves are unimportant for this comparison,
    but we can assume they perform a variety of realtime I/O functions. As a
    result, a number of device drivers are also implemented.

    Code Space and Memory Overhead:

    The application is compiled for an ATMega328p processor which contains 32kB
    of code space in flash, and 2kB of RAM, which is a lower-mid-range
    microcontroller in Atmel's 8-bit AVR line of microcontrollers. Using the AVR
    GCC compiler with -Os level optimizations, an executable is produced with the
    following code/RAM utilization:

    \verbatim
    Program:   27914 bytes
    Data:       1313 bytes
    \endverbatim

    An alternate version of this project is created using a custom "super-loop"
    kernel, which uses a single application thread and provides 2 levels of
    priority (interrupt and application). In this case, the event handler
    processes the different priority application events to completion from
    highest to lowest priority.

    This approach leaves the application itself largely unchanged. Using the same
    optimization levels as the preemptive kernel, the code compiles as follows:

    \verbatim
    Program:   24886 bytes
    Data:        750 bytes
    \endverbatim

    At first glance, the difference in RAM utilization seems quite a lot higher
    for the preemptive mode version of the application, but the raw numbers don't
    tell the whole story.

    The first issue is that the cooperative-mode total does not take into account
    the system stack - whereas these values are included in the totals for RTOS
    version of the project. As a result, some further analysis is required to
    determine how the stack sizes truly compare.

    In cooperative mode, there is only one thread of execution - so considering
    that multiple event handlers are executed in turn, the stack requirements for
    cooperative mode is simply determined by those of the most stack-intensive
    event handler (ignoring stack use contributions due to interrupts).

    In contrast, the preemptive kernel requires a separate stack for each active
    thread, and as a result the stack usage of the system is the sum of the stacks
    for all threads.

    Since the application and idle events are the same for both preemptive and
    cooperative mode, we know that their (independent) stack requirements will
    be the same in both cases.

    For cooperative mode, we see that the idle thread stack utilization is lower
    than that of the application thread, and so the application thread's determines
    the stack size requirement. Again, with the preemptive kernel the stack
    utilization is the sum of the stacks defined for both threads.

    As a result, the difference in overhead between the two cases becomes the
    extra stack required for the idle thread - which in our case is (a somewhat
    generous) 128 bytes.

    The numbers still don't add up completely, but looking into the linker output
    we see that the rest of the difference comes from the extra data structures
    used to manage the kernel in preemptive mode, and the kernel data itself.

    Fixed kernel data costs:
    \verbatim
    --- 134 Bytes Kernel data
    --- 26 Bytes Kernel Vtables
    \endverbatim

    Application (Variable) data costs:
    \verbatim
    --- 24 Bytes Driver Vtables
    --- 123 Bytes – statically-allocated kernel objects (semaphores, timers, etc.)
    \endverbatim

    With this taken into account, the true memory cost of a 2-thread system ends
    up being around 428 bytes of RAM - which is about 20% of the total memory
    available on this particular microcontroller. Whether or not this is
    reasonable certainly depends on the application, but more importantly, it is
    not so unreasonable as to eliminate an RTOS-based solution from being
    considered. Also note that by using the “simulated idle” feature provided in
    Mark3 R3 and onward, the idle thread (and its associated stack) can be
    eliminated altogether to reduce the cost in constrained devices.

    The difference in code space overhead between the preemptive and cooperative
    mode solutions is less of an issue. Part of this reason is that both the
    preemptive and cooperative kernels are relatively small, and even an average
    target device (like the Atmega328 we've chosen) has plenty of room.

    Mark3 can be configured so that only features necessary for the application
    are included in the RTOS - you only pay for the parts of the system that you
    use. In this way, we can measure the overhead on a feature-by-feature basis,
    which is shown below for the kernel as configured for this application:

    \verbatim
    Kernel ................. 2563 Bytes
    Synchronization Objects.  644 Bytes
    Port ...................  974 Bytes
    Features ...............  871 Bytes
    \endverbatim

    The configuration tested in this comparison uses the thread/port module with
    timers, drivers, and semaphores, and mutexes, for a total kernel size of
    5052 Bytes, with the rest of the code space occupied by the application.

    As can be seen from the compiler's output, the difference in code space
    between the two versions of the application is 3028 bytes - or about 9% of
    the available code space on the selected processor.  While nearly all of
    this comes from the added overhead of the kernel, the rest of the difference
    comes the changes to the application necessary to facilitate the different
    frameworks.  This also demonstrates that the system-software code size in the
    cooperative case is about 2024 bytes.

    \section CANRTOSOVERHEAD Runtime Overhead

    On the cooperative kernel, the overhead associated with running the thread
    is the time it takes the kernel to notice a pending event flag and launch the
    appropriate event handler, plus the timer interrupt execution time.

    Similarly, on the preemptive kernel, the overhead is the time it takes to
    switch contexts to the application thread, plus the timer interrupt execution
    time.

    The timer interrupt overhead is similar for both cases, so the overhead then
    becomes the difference between the following:

    Preemptive mode:
    - Posting the semaphore that wakes the high-priority thread
    - Performing a context switch to the high-priority thread
    .

    Cooperative mode:
    - Setting the event flag from the timer interrupt
    - Acknowledging the event from the event loop
    .

    coop – 438 cycles
    preempt – 764 cycles

    Using a cycle-accurate AVR simulator (flAVR) running with a simulated speed
    of 16MHz, we find the end-to-end event sequence time to be 27us for the
    cooperative mode scheduler and 48us for the preemptive, and a raw difference
    of 20us.

    With a fixed high-priority event frequency of 30Hz, we achieve a runtime
    overhead of 611us per second, or 0.06% of the total available CPU time. Now,
    obviously this value would expand at higher event frequencies and/or slower
    CPU frequencies, but for this typical application we find the difference in
    runtime overhead to be neglible for a preemptive system.

    \section CANRTOSANALYSIS Analysis

    For the selected test application and platform, including a preemptive RTOS
    is entirely reasonable, as the costs are low relative to a non-preemptive
    kernel solution. But these costs scale relative to the speed, memory and
    code space of the target processor. Because of these variables, there is no
    "magic bullet" environment suitable for every application, but Mark3 attempts
    to provide a framework suitable for a wide range of targets.

    On the one hand, if these tests had been performed on a higher-end
    microcontroller such as the ATMega1284p (containing 128kB of code space and
    16kB of RAM), the overhead would be in the noise. For this type of
    resource-rich microcontroller, there would be no reason to avoid using
    the Mark3 preemptive kernel.

    Conversely, using a lower-end microcontroller like an ATMega88pa (which has
    only 8kB of code space and 1kB of RAM), the added overhead would likely be
    prohibitive for including a preemptive kernel. In this case, the
    cooperative-mode kernel would be a better choice.

    As a rule of thumb, if one budgets 25% of a microcontroller's code space/RAM
    for system code, you should only require at minimum a microcontroller with
    16k of code space and 2kB of RAM as a base platform for an RTOS. Unless there
    are serious constraints on the system that require much better latency or
    responsiveness than can be achieved with RTOS overhead, almost any modern
    platform is sufficient for hosting a kernel. In the event you find yourself
    with a microprocessor with external memory, there should be no reason to
    avoid using an RTOS at all.

    \page INSIDEMARK3 Mark3 Design Goals

    \section INSIDEOVERVIEW Overview

    \subsection INSIDEOVERSERVICES Services Provided by an RTOS Kernel

    At its lowest-levels, an operating system kernel is responsible for managing
    and scheduling resources within a system according to the application.  In a
    typical thread-based RTOS, the resources involved is CPU time, and the kernel
    manages this by scheduling threads and timers.  But capable RTOS kernels
    provide much more than just threading and timers.

    In the following section, we discuss the Mark3 kernel architecture, all of
    its features, and a thorough discussion of how the pieces all work together
    to make an awesome RTOS kernel.

    \subsection INSIDEOVERPRINCIPLES Guiding Principles of Mark3

    Mark3 was designed with a number of over-arching principles, coming from
    years of experience designing, implementing, refining, and experimenting with
    RTOS kernels.  Through that process I not only discovered what features I
    wanted in an RTOS, but how I wanted to build those features to look, work,
    and “feel”.   With that understanding, I started with a clean slate and
    began designing a new RTOS.  Mark3 is the result of that process, and its
    design goals can be summarized in the following guiding principles.

    \subsection INSIDEOVERBFC Be feature competitive

    To truly be taken seriously as more than just a toy or educational tool, an
    RTOS needs to have a certain feature suite.  While Mark3 isn't a clone of any
    existing RTOS, it should at least attempt parity with the most common
    software in its class.

    Looking at its competitors, Mark3 as a kernel supports most, if not all of
    the compelling features found in modern RTOS kernels, including dynamic
    threads, tickless timers, efficient message passing, and multiple types of
    synchronization primatives.

    \subsection INSIDEOVERBHC Be highly configuration

    Mark3 isn't a one-size-fits-all kernel – and as a result, it provides the
    means to build a custom kernel to suit your needs.  By configuring the
    kernel at compile-time, Mark3 can be built to contain the optimal feature
    set for a given application.  And since features can be configured
    individually, you only pay the code/RAM footprint for the features you
    actually use.

    \subsection INSIDEOVERNED No external dependencies, no new language features

    To maximize portability and promote adoption to new platforms, Mark3 is
    written in a widely supported subset of C++ that lends itself to embedded
    applications.  It avoids RTTI, exceptions, templates, and libraries (C
    standard, STL, etc.), with all fundamental data structures and types
    implemented completely for use by the kernel.  As a result, the portable
    parts of Mark3 should compile for any capable C++ toolchain.

    \subsection INSIDEOVERHPA Target the most popular hobbyist platforms available

    Realistically, this means supporting the various Arduino-compatible target
    CPUs, including AVR and ARM Cortex-M series microcontrollers.  As a result,
    the current default target for Mark3 is the atmega328p, which has 32KB of
    flash and 2KB of RAM.  All decisions regarding default features, code size,
    and performance need to take that target system into account.

    Mark3 integrates cleanly as a library into the Arduino IDE to support
    atmega328-based targets.  Other AVR and Cortex-M targets can be supported
    using the port code provided in the source package.

    \subsection INSIDEOVERMAXDET Maximize determinism – but be pragmatic

    Guaranteeing deterministic and predictable behavior is tough to do in an
    embedded system, and often comes with a heavy price tag in either RAM or
    code-space.  With Mark3, we strive to keep the core kernel APIs and features
    as lightweight as possible, while avoiding algorithms that don't scale to
    large numbers of threads.  We also achieve minimal latency by keeping
    interrupts enabled (operating out of the critical section) wherever possible.

    In Mark3, the most important parts of the kernel are fixed-time, including
    thread scheduling and context switching.  Operations that are not fixed time
    can be characterized as a function of their dependent data data.  For
    instances, the Mutex and Semaphore APIs operate in fixed time in the
    uncontested case, and execute in linear time for the contested case – where
    the speed of execution is dependent on the number of threads currently
    waiting on that object.

    The caveat here is that while we want to minimize latency and time spent in
    critical sections, that has to be balanced against increases in code size,
    and uncontested-case performance.

    \subsection INSIDEOVERENG Apply engineering principles – and that means discipline, measurement and verification

    My previous RTOS, FunkOS, was designed to be very ad-hoc.  The usage
    instructions were along the lines of “drag and drop the source files into
    your IDE and compile”.  There was no regression/unit testing, no code
    size/speed profiling, and all documentation was done manually.  It worked,
    but the process was a bit of a mess, and resulted in a lot of re-spins of
    the software, and a lot of time spent stepping through emulators to measure
    parameters.

    We take a different approach in Mark3.  Here, we've designed not only the
    kernel-code, but the build system, unit tests, profiling code, documentation
    and reporting that supports the kernel.  Each release is built and tested
    using automation in order to ensure quality and correctness, with supporting
    documentation containing all critical metrics.  Only code that passes
    testing is submitted to the repos and public forums for distribution.  These
    metrics can be traced from build-to-build to ensure that performance remains
    consistent from one drop to the next, and that no regressions are introduced
    by new/refactored code.

    And while the kernel code can still be exported into an IDE directly, that
    takes place with the knowledge that the kernel code has already been
    rigorously tested and profiled.  Exporting source in Mark3 is also supported
    by scripting to ensure reliable, reproducible results without the possibility
    for human-error.

    \subsection INSIDEOVERFLAVR Use Virtualization For Verification

    Mark3 was designed to work with automated simulation tools as the primary
    means to validate changes to the kernel, due to the power and flexibility
    of automatic tests on virtual hardware.  I was also intrigued by the thought
    of extending the virtual target to support functionality useful for a kernel,
    but not found on real hardware.

    When the project was started, simavr was the tool of choice- however, its
    simulation was found to be incorrect compared to execution on a real MCU, and
    it did not provide the degree of extension that I desired for use with kernel
    development.

    The flAVR AVR simulator was written to replace the dependency on that tool,
    and overcome those limitations.  It also provides a GDB interface, as well as
    its own built-in debugger, profilers, and trace tools.

    The example and test code relies heavily on flAVR kernel aware messaging, so
    it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with that tool if you intend
    to do any sort of customizations or extensions to the kernel.

    flAVR is hosted on sourceforge at http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/flavr/ .
    In its basic configuration, it builds with minimal external dependencies.

    - On linux, it requires only pthreads.
    - On Windows, it rquires pthreads and ws2_32, both satisfied via MinGW.
    - Optional SDL builds for both targets (featuring graphics and simulated joystick
      input) can be built, and rely on libSDL.

    The ability to multiplex the CPU between multiple tasks to give the perception
    that multiple programs are running simultaneously.  Each thread runs in its
    own context with its own stack.

    <b>Scheduler:</b>
    Algorithm which determines the thread that gets to run on the CPU at any
    given time.  This algorithm takes into account the priorites (and other
    execution parameters) associated with the threads in the system.

    <b>IPC:</b>
    Inter-process-communications.  Message-passing and Mailbox interfaces used
    to communicate between threads synchronously or asynchronously.

    <b>Synchronization Objects:</b>
    Ability to schedule thread execution relative to system conditions and events,
    allowing for sharing global data and resources safely and effectively.

    <b>Timers:</b>
    High-resolution software timers that allow for actions to be triggered on a
    periodic or one-shot basis.

    <b>Profiler:</b>
    Special timer used to measure the performance of arbitrary blocks of code.

    <b>Debugging:</b>
    Realitme logging and trace functionality, facilitating simplified debugging
    of systems using the OS.

    <b>Atomics:</b>
    Support for UN-interruptble arithmatic operations.

    <b>Driver API:</b>
    Hardware abstraction interface allowing for device drivers to be written in
    a consistent, portable manner.

    <b>Hardware Abstraction Layer:</b>
    Class interface definitions to represent threading, context-switching, and
    timers in a generic, abstracted manner.

    <b>Porting Layer:</b>
    Class interface implementation to support threading, context-switching, and
    timers for a given CPU.

    <b>User Drivers:</b>
    Code written by the user to implement device-specific peripheral drivers,
    built to make use of the Mark3 driver API.

    Each of these features will be described in more detail in the following
    sections of this chapter.

    The concepts introduced in the above architecture are implemented in a
    variety of source modules, which are logically broken down into classes (or
    in some cases, groups of functions/macros).  The relationship between objects
    in the Mark3 kernel is shown below:

    The objects shown in the preceding table can be grouped together by feature.
    In the table below, we group each feature by object, referencing the source
    module in which they can be found in the Mark3 source tree.

    \section THREADSCHED Threads and Scheduling

    The classes involved in threading and scheudling in Mark3 are highlighted
    in the following diagram, and are discussed in detail in this chapter:

    \image html Mark3_arch24.png
    \image latex Mark3_arch24.png "Threads and Scheduling" width=10cm

    \subsection BITTHREAD A Bit About Threads

    Before we get started talking about the internals of the Mark3 scheduler,
    it's necessary to go over some background material - starting with:  what is
    a thread, anyway?

    Let's look at a very basic CPU without any sort of special multi-threading
    hardware, and without interrupts.  When the CPU is powered up, the program
    counter is loaded with some default location, at which point the processor
    core will start executing instructions sequentially - running forever and
    ever according to whatever has been loaded into program memory.  This single
    instance of a simple program sequence is the only thing that runs on the
    processor, and the execution of the program can be predicted entirely by
    looking at the CPU's current register state, its program, and any affected
    system memory (the CPU's "context").

    It's simple enough, and that's exactly the definition we have for a thread
    in an RTOS.

    Each thread contains an instance of a CPU's register context, its own stack,
    and any other bookkeeping information necessary to define the minimum unique
    execution state of a system at runtime.  It is the job of a RTOS to multiplex
    the execution of multiple threads on a single physical CPU, thereby creating
    the illusion that many programs are being executed simultaneously.  In
    reality there can only ever be one thread truly executing at any given moment
    on a CPU core, so it's up to the scheduler to set and enforce rules about
    what thread gets to run when, for how long, and under what conditions.  As
    mentioned earlier, any system without an RTOS exeuctes as a single thread,
    so at least two threads are required for an RTOS to serve any useful purpose.

    Note that all of this information is is common to pretty well every RTOS in
    existence - the implementation details, including the scheduler rules, are
    all part of what differentiates one RTOS from another.

    \subsection THREADLISTS Thread States and ThreadLists

    Since only one thread can run on a CPU at a time, the scheduler relies on
    thread information to make its decisions.  Mark3's scheduler relies on a
    variety of such information, including:

    - The thread's current priority
    - Round-Robin execution quanta
    - Whether or not the thread is blocked on a synchronization object, such as a mutex or semaphore
    - Whether or not the thread is currently suspended
    .

    The scheduler further uses this information to logically place each thread
    into 1 of 4 possible states:

        - Ready - The thread is currently running
        - Running - The thread is able to run
        - Blocked - The thread cannot run until a system condition is met
        - Stopped - The thread cannot run because its execution has been suspended
        .

    In order to determine a thread's state, threads are placed in "buckets"
    corresponding to these states.  Ready and running threads exist in the
    scheduler's buckets, blocked threads exist in a bucket belonging to the
    object they're blocked on, and stopped threads exist in a separate bucket
    containing all stopped threads.

    In reality, the various buckets are just doubly-linked lists of Thread
    objects - implemented in something called the ThreadList class.  To
    facilitate this, the Thread class directly inherits from a LinkListNode class,
    which contains the node pointers required to implement a doubly-linked list.
    As a result, Threads may be effortlessly moved from one state to another
    using efficient linked-list operations built into the ThreadList class.

    \subsection BLOCKUNBLOCK Blocking and Unblocking

    While many developers new to the concept of an RTOS assume that all threads
    in a system are entirely separate from eachother, the reality is that
    practical systems typically involve multiple threads working together, or
    at the very least sharing resources.  In order to synchronize the execution
    of threads for that purpose, a number of synchronization primatives (blocking
    objects) are implemented to create specific sets of conditions under which
    threads can continue execution.  The concept of "blocking" a thread until a
    specific condition is met is fundamental to understanding RTOS applications
    design, as well as any highly-multithreaded applications.

    \subsection BLOCKOBJ Blocking Objects

    Blocking objects and primatives provided by Mark3 include:

    - Semaphores (binary and counting)
    - Mutexes
    - Event Flags
    - Thread Notification Objects
    - Thread Sleep
    - Message Queues
    - Mailboxes
    .

    The relationship between these objects in the system are shown below:

    \image html Mark3_arch21.png
    \image latex Mark3_arch21.png "Blocking Objects" width=10cm

    Each of these objects inherit from the BlockingObject class, which itself
    contains a ThreadList object.  This class contains methods to Block() a
    thread (remove it from the Scheduler's "Ready" or "Running" ThreadLists),
    as well as UnBlock() a thread (move a thread back to the "Ready" lists). This
    object handles transitioning threads from list-to-list (and state-to-state),
    as well as taking care of any other Scheduler bookkeeping required in the
    process.  While each of the Blocking types implement a different condition,
    they are effectively variations on the same theme.  Many simple Blocking
    objects are also used to build complex blocking objects - for instance, the
    Thread Sleep mechanism is essentially a binary semaphore and a timer object,
    while a message queue is a linked-list of message objects combined with a
    semaphore.

    \section INSIDESCHED Inside the Mark3 Scheduler

    At this point we've covered the following concepts:

    - Threads
    - Thread States and Thread Lists
    - Blocking and Un-Blocking Threads
    .

    Thankfully, this is all the background required to understand how the Mark3
    Scheduler works.  In technical terms, Mark3 implements "strict priority
    scheduling, with round-robin scheduling among threads in each priority group".
    In plain English, this boils down to a scheduler which follows a few simple
    rules:

    \verbatim
        Find the highest-priority "Ready" list that has at least one Threads.
        If the first thread in that bucket is not the current thread, select it
        to run next. Otherwise, rotate the linked list, and choose the next
        thread in the list to run
    \endverbatim

    Since context switching is one of the most common and frequent operation
    performed by an RTOS, this needs to be as fast and deterministic as possible.
    While the logic is simple, a lot of care must be put into optimizing the
    scheduler to achieve those goals.  In the section below we discuss the
    optimization approaches taken in Mark3.

    There are a number of ways to find the highest-priority thread.  The naive
    approach would be to simply iterate through the scheduler's array of
    ThreadLists from highest to lowest, stopping when the first non-empty list
    is found, such as in the following block of code:

    \code{.cpp}
    for (prio = num_prio - 1; prio >= 0; prio--)
    {
        if (thread_list[prio].get_head() != NULL)
        {
            break;
        }
    }
    \endcode
    
    While that would certainly work and be sufficient for a variety of systems,
    it's a non-deterministic approach (complexity O(n)) whose cost varies
    substantially based on how many priorities have to be evaluated.  It's simple
    to read and understand, but it's non-optimal.

    Fortunatley, a functionally-equivalent and more deterministic approach can
    be implemented with a few tricks.

    In addition to maintaining an array of ThreadLists, Mark3 also maintains a
    bitmap (one bit per priority level) that indicates which thread lists have
    ready threads.  This bitmap is maintained automatically by the ThreadList
    class, and is updated every time a thread is moved to/from the Scheduler's
    ready lists.

    By inspecting this bitmap using a technique to count the leading zero bits
    in the bitmap, we determine which threadlist to choose in fixed time.

    Now, to implement the leading-zeros check, this can once again be performed
    iteratively using bitshifts and compares (which isn't any more efficient
    than the raw list traversal), but it can also be evaluated using either a
    lookup table, or via a special CPU instruction to count the leading zeros in
    a value.  In Mark3, we opt for the lookup-table approach since we have a
    limited number of priorities and not all supported CPU architectures support
    a count leading zero instruction.  To achieve a balance between performance
    and memory use, we use a 4-bit lookup table (costing 16 bytes) to perform
    the lookup.

    (As a sidenote - this is actually a very common approach  in OS schedulers.
    It's actually part of the reason why modern ARM cores implement a dedicated
    count-leading-zeros [CLZ] instruction!)

    With a 4-bit lookup table and an 8-bit priority-level bitmap, the priority
    check algorithm looks something like this:

    \code{.cpp}
    // Check the highest 4 priority levels, represented in the
    // upper 4 bits in the bitmap
    priority = priority_lookup_table[(priority_bitmap >> 4)];

    // priority is non-zero if we found something there
    if( priority )
    {
        // Add 4 because we were looking at the higher levels
        priority += 4;
    }
    else
    {
        // Nothing in the upper 4, look at the lowest 4 priority levels
        // represented by the lowest 4 bits in the bitmap
        priority = priority_lookup_table[priority_bitmap & 0x0F];
    }
    \endcode
    
    Deconstructing this algorithm, you can see that the priority lookup will have
    on O(1) complexity - and is extremely low-cost.

    This operation is thus fully deterministic and time bound - no matter how
    many threads are scheduled, the operation will always be time-bound to the
    most expensive of these two code paths.  Even with only 8 priority levels,
    this is still much faster than iteratively checking the thread lists manually,
    compared with the previous example implementation.

    Once the priority level has been found, selecting the next thread to run is
    trivial, consisting of something like this:

    next_thread = thread_list[prio].get_head();

    In the case of the get_head() calls, this evaluates to an inline-load of the
    "head" pointer in the particular thread list.

    One important thing to take away from this analysis is that the scheduler is
    only responsible for selecting the next-to-run thread.  In fact, these two
    operations are totally decoupled - no context switching is performed by the
    scheduler, and the scheduler isn't called from the context switch.  The
    scheduler simply produces new "next thread" values that are consumed from
    within the context switch code.

    \subsection RRSCHED Considerations for Round-Robin Scheduling

    One thing that isn't considered directly from the scheduler algorithm is the
    problem of dealing with multiple threads within a single priority group; all
    of the alorithms that have been explored above simply look at the first
    Thread in each group.

    Mark3 addresses this issue indirectly, using a software timer to manage
    round-robin scheduling, as follows.

    In some instances where the scheduler is run by the kernel directly
    (typically as a result of calling Thread::Yield()), the kernel will perfom
    an additional check after running the Scheduler to determine whether or
    there are multiple ready Threadsin the priority of the next ready thread.


    If there are multiple threads within that priority, the kernel adds a
    one-shot software timer which is programmed to expire at the next Thread's
    configured quantum.  When this timer expires, the timer's callback function
    executes to perform two simple operations:

    "Pivot" the current Thread's priority list.
    Set a flag telling the kernel to trigger a Yield after exiting the main
    TimerScheduler processing loop

    Pivoting the thread list basically moves the head of a circular-linked-list
    to its next value, which in our case ensures that a new thread will be
    chosen the next time the scheduler is run (the scheduler only looks at the
    head node of the priority lists).  And by calling Yield, the system forces
    the scheduler t run, a new round-robin software timer to be installed (if
    necssary), and triggers a context switch SWI to load the newly-chosen thread.
    Note that if the thread attached to the round-robin timer is pre-empted, the
    kernel will take steps to abort and invalidate that round-robin software
    timer, installing a new one tied to the next thread to run if necessary.

    Because the round-robin software timer is dynamically installed when there
    are multiple ready threads at the highest ready priority level, there is no
    CPU overhead with this feature unless that condition is met.  The cost of
    round-robin scheduling is also fixed - no matter how many threads there are,
    and the cost is identical to any other one-shot software timer in the system.

    \subsection CONSWITCH Context Switching

    There's really not much to say about the actual context switch operation at
    a high level.  Context switches are triggered whenever it has been determined
    that a new thread needs to be swapped into the CPU core when the scheduler
    is run.  Mark3 implements also context switches as a call to a software
    interrupt - on AVR platforms, we typically use INT0 or INT2 for this (although
    any pin-change GPIO interrupt can be used), and on ARM we achieve this by
    triggering a PendSV exception.

    However, regardless of the architecture, the contex-switch ISR will perform
    the following three operations:

    Save the current Thread's context to the current Thread stack
    Make the "next to run" thread the "currently running" thread
    Restore the context of the next Thread from the Thread stack

    The code to implement the context switch is entirely architecture-specific,
    so it won't be discussed in detail here.  It's almost always gory
    inline-assembly which is used to load and store various CPU registers, and
    is highly-optimized for speed.  We dive into an example implementation for
    the ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller in a later section of this book.

    \subsection ALLTOGETHER Putting It All Together

    In short, we can say that the Mark3 scheduler works as follows:

    - The scheduler is run whenever a Thread::Yield() is called by a user, as part
      of blocking calls, or whenever a new thread is started
    - The Mark3 scheduler is deterministic, selecting the next thread to run in
      fixed-time
    - The scheduler only chooses the next thread to run, the context switch SWI
      consumes that information to get that thread running
    - Where there are multiple ready threads in the highest populated priority
      level, a software timer is used to manage round-robin scheduling
    .

    While we've covered a lot of ground in this section, there's not a whole lot
    of code involved.  However, the code that performs these operations is
    nuanced and subtle.  If you're interested in seeing how this all works in
    practice, I suggest reading through the Mark3 source code (which is heavily
    annotated), and stepping through the code with a simulator/emulator.

    \section ARCHTIMERS Timers

    Mark3 implements one-shot and periodic software-timers via the Timer class.
    The user configures the timer for duration, repetition, and action, at which
    point the timer can be activated.  When an active timer expires, the kernel calls
    a user-specified callback function, and then reloads the timer in the case of
    periodic timers.  The same timer objects exposed to the user are also used
    within the kernel to implement round-robin scheduling, and timeout-based APIs
    for seamphores, mutexes, events, and messages.

    Timers are implemented using the following components in the Mark3 Kernel:

    \image html Mark3_arch20.png
    \image latex Mark3_arch20.png "Timers" width=10cm

    The Timer class provides the basic periodic and one-shot timer functionality
    used by applicaiton code, blocking objects, and IPC.

    The TimerList class implements a doubly-linked list of Timer objects, and
    the logic required to implement a timer tick (tick-based kernel) or timer
    expiry (tickless kernel) event.

    The TimerScheduler class contains a single TimerList object, implementing a
    single, system-wide list of Timer objects within the kernel.  It also
    provides hooks for the hardware timer, such that when a timer tick or expiry
    event occurs, the TimerList expiry handler is run.

    The KernelTimer class (kerneltimer.cpp/.h) implements the CPU specific hardware
    timer driver that is used by the kernel and the TimerScheduler to implement
    software timers.

    While extremely simple to use, they provide one of the most powerful
    execution contexts in the system.

    The software timers implemented in Mark3 use interrupt-nesting within the
    kernel timer's interrupt handler.  This context is be considered
    higher-priority than the highest priority user thread, but lower-priority
    than other interrupts in the system.  As a result, this minimizes critical
    interrupt latency in the system, albeit at the expense of responsiveness of
    the user-threads.

    For this reason, it's critical to ensure that all timer callback events are
    kept as short as possible to prevent adding thread-level latency.  All
    heavy-lifting should be left to the threads, so the callback should only
    implement signalling via IPC or synchronization object.

    The time spent in this interrupt context is also dependent on the number of
    active timers at any given time.  However, Mark3 also can be used to minimize
    the frequency of these interrupts wakeups, by using an optional “tolerance”
    parameter in the timer API calls.  In this way, periodic tasks that have
    less rigorous real-time constraints can all be grouped together – executing
    as a group instead of one-after-another.

    Mark3 also contains two different timer implementations that can be
    configured at build-time, each with their own advantages.

    \subsection TICKBASEDTIMERS Tick-based Timers

    In a tick-based timing scheme, the kernel relies on a system-timer interrupt
    to fire at a relatively-high frequency, on which all kernel timer events are
    derived.  On modern CPUs and microcontrollers, a 1kHz system tick is common,
    although quite often lower frequencies such as 60Hz, 100Hz, or 120Hz are used.
    The resolution of this timer also defines the maximum resolution of timer
    objects as a result.  That is, if the timer frequency is 1kHz, a user cannot
    specify a timer resolution lowerthan 1ms.

    The advantage of a tick-based timer is its sheer simplicity.  It typically
    doesn't take much to set up a timer to trigger an interrupt at a
    fixed-interval, at which point, all system timer intervals are decremented
    by 1 count.  When each system timer interval reaches zero, a callback is
    called for the event, and the events are either reset and restarted (repeated
    timers) or cleared (1-shot).

    Unfortunately, that simplicity comes at a cost of increased interrupt count,
    which cause frequent CPU wakeups and utilization, and power consumption.

    \subsection TICKLESSTIMERS Tickless Timers

    In a tickless system, the kernel timer only runs when there are active
    timers pending expiry, and even then, the timer module only generates
    interrupts when a timer expires, or a timer reaches its maximum count value.
    Additionally, when there are no active timer objects, the timer can is
    completely disabled – saving even more cycles, power, and CPU wakeups.
    These factors make the tickless timer approach a highly-optimal solution,
    suitable for a wide array of low-power applications.

    Also, since tickless timers do not rely on a fixed, periodic clock, they can
    potentially be higher resolution.  The only limitation in timer resolution
    is the precision of the underlying hardware timer as configured.  For
    example, if a 32kHz hardware timer is being used to drive the timer scheduler,
    the resolution of timer objects would be in the ~33us range.

    The only downside of the tickless timer system is an added complexity to the
    timer code, requiring more code space, and slightly longer execution of the
    timer routines when the timer interrupt is executed.

    \subsection TIMERPA Timer Processing Algorithm
    
    Timer interrupts occur at either a fixed-frequency (tick-based), or at the
    next timer expiry interval (tickless), at which point the timer processing
    algorithm runs.  While the timer count is reset by the timer-interrupt, it is
    still allowed to accumulate ticks while this algorithm is executed in order
    to ensure that timer-accuracy is kept in real-time.  It is also important to
    note that round-robin scheduling changes are disabled during the execution
    of this algorithm to prevent race conditions, as the round-robin code also
    relies on timer objects.

    All active timer objects are stored in a doubly-linked list within the
    timer-scheduler, and this list is processed in two passes by the alogirthm
    which runs from the timer-interrupt (with interrupt nesting enabled).  The
    first pass determines which timers have expired and the next timer interval,
    while the second pass deals with executing the timer callbacks themselves.
    Both phases are discussed in more detail below.

    In the first pass, the active timers are decremented by either 1 tick
    (tick-based), or by the duration of the last elapsed timer interval (tickless).
    Timers that have zero (or less-than-zero) time remaining have a “callback”
    flag set, telling the algorithm to call the timer's callback function in the
    second pass of the loop.  In the event of a periodic timer, the timer's
    interval is reset to its starting value.

    For the tickless case, the next timer interval is also computed in the
    first-pass by looking for the active timer with the least amount of time
    remaining in its interval.  Note that this calculation is irrelevant in the
    tick-based timer code, as the timer interrupt fires at a fixed-frequency.

    In the second pass, the algorithms loops through the list of active timers,
    looking for those with their  “callback” flag set in the first pass.  The
    callback function is then executed for each expired timer, and the “callback”
    flag cleared.  In the event that a non-periodic (one-shot) timer expires, the
    timer is also removed from the timer scheduler at this time.

    In a tickless system, once the second pass of the loop has been completed,
    the hardware timer is checked to see if the next timer interval has expired
    while processing the expired timer callbacks.  In that event, the complete
    algorithm is re-run to ensure that no expired timers are missed.  Once the
    algorithm has completed without the next timer expiring during processing,
    the expiry time is programmed into the hardware timer.  Round-robin scheduling
    is re-enabled, and if a new thread has been scheduled as a result of action
    taken during a timer callback, a context switch takes place on return from
    the timer interrupt.

    \section SYNCHIPC Synchronization and IPC

    \image latex Mark3_arch21.png "Synchronization and IPC" width=10cm

    \section BLOCKINGOBJECTS Blocking Objects

    A Blocking object in Mark3 is essentially a thread list.  Any blocking object
    implementation (being a semaphore, mutex, event flag, etc.) canbe built on
    top of this class, utilizing the provided functions to manipulate thread
    location within the Kernel.

    Blocking a thread results in that thread becoming de-scheduled, placed in
    the blocking object's own private list of threads which are waiting on the
    object.

    Unblocking a thread results in the reverse:  The thread is moved back to its
    original location from the blocking list.

    The only difference between a blocking object based on this class is the
    logic used to determine what consitutes a Block or Unblock condition.

    For instance, a semaphore Pend operation may result in a call to the Block()
    method with the currently-executing thread in order to make that thread wait
    for a semaphore Post.  That operation would then invoke the UnBlock() method,
    removing the blocking thread from the semaphore's list, and back into the
    appropriate thread inside the scheduler.

    Care must be taken when implementing blocking objects to ensure that critical
    sections are used judiciously, otherwise asynchronous events like timers and
    interrupts could result in non-deterministic and often catastrophic behavior.

    Mark3 implements a variety of blocking objects including semaphores, mutexes,
    event flags, and IPC mechanisms that all inherit from the basic Blocking-object
    class found in blocking.h/cpp, ensuring consistency and a high degree of
    code-reuse between components.

    \subsection SEMAPHORES Semaphores

    Semaphores are used to synchronized execution of threads based on the
    availability (and quantity) of application-specific resources in the system.
    They are extremely useful for solving producer-consumer     problems, and are
    the method-of-choice for creating efficient, low latency systems, where ISRs
    post semaphores that are handled from within the context of individual
    threads.  Semaphores can also be posted (but not pended) from within the
    interrupt context.

    \subsection MUTEX Mutex

    Mutexes (Mutual exclusion objects) are provided as a means of creating
    "protected sections" around a particular resource, allowing for access of
    these objects to be serialized. Only one thread can hold the mutex at a time
    - other threads have to wait until the region is released by the owner thread
    before they can take their turn operating on the protected resource. Note
    that mutexes can only be owned by threads - they are not available to other
    contexts (i.e. interrupts). Calling the mutex APIs 	from an interrupt will cause
    catastrophic system failures.

    Note that these objects are recursive in Mark3 - that is, the owner thread
    can claim a mutex more than once.  The caveat here is that a recursively-held
    mutex will not be released until a matching “release” call is made for each
    “claim” call.

    Prioritiy inheritence is provided with these objects as a means to avoid
    prioritiy inversions. Whenever a thread at a priority than the mutex owner
    blocks on a mutex, the priority of the current thread is boosted to the
    highest-priority waiter to ensure that other tasks at intermediate priorities
    cannot artificically prevent progress from being made.

    \subsection EVENTFLAG Event Flags

    Event Flags are another synchronization object, conceptually similar to a
    semaphore.

    Unlike a semaphore, however, the condition on which threads are unblocked is
    determined by a more complex set of rules.  Each Event Flag object contains
    a 16-bit field, and threads block, waiting for combinations of bits within
    this field to become set.

    A thread can wait on any pattern of bits from this field to be set, and any
    number of threads can wait on any number of different patterns.  Threads can
    wait on a single bit, multiple bits, or bits from within a subset of bits
    within the field.

    As a result, setting a single value in the flag can result in any number of
    threads becoming unblocked simultaneously.  This mechanism is extremely
    powerful, allowing for all sorts of complex, yet efficient, thread
    synchronization schemes that can be created using a single shared object.

    Note that Event Flags can be set from interrupts, but you cannot wait on an
    event flag from within an interrupt.

    \subsection NOTIFICATION Notification Objects

    Notification objects are the most lightweight of all blocking objects
    supplied by Mark3.

    using this blocking primative, one or more threads wait for the notification
    object to be signalled by code elsewhere in the system (i.e. another thread
    or interrupt).  Once the notification has been signalled, all threads
    currently blocked on the object become unblocked and moved into the ready list.

    Signalling a notification object that has no actively-waiting threads has no
    effect.

    \section MSGMSGQ Messages and Global Message Queue

    \subsection MESSAGES Messages

    Sending messages between threads is the key means of synchronizing access to
    data, and the primary mechanism to perform asynchronous data processing
    operations.

    Sending a message consists of the following operations:

    - Obtain a Message object from the global message pool
    - Set the message data and event fields
    - Send the message to the destination message queue
    .

    While receiving a message consists of the following steps:

    - Wait for a messages in the destination message queue
    - Process the message data
    - Return the message back to the global message pool
    .

    These operations, and the various data objects involved are discussed in
    more detail in the following section.

    \subsection MESSAGEOBJ Message Objects

    Message objects are used to communicate arbitrary data between threads in a
    safe and synchronous way.

    The message object consists of an event code field and a data field. The
    event code is used to provide context to the message object, while the data
    field (essentially a void * data pointer) is used to provide a payload of
    data corresponding to the particular event.

    Access to these fields is marshalled by accessors - the transmitting thread
    uses the SetData() and SetCode() methods to seed the data, while the
    receiving thread uses the GetData() and GetCode() methods to retrieve it.

    By providing the data as a void data pointer instead of a fixed-size message,
    we achieve an unprecedented measure of simplicity and flexibility. Data can
    be either statically or dynamically allocated, and sized appropriately for
    the event without having to format and reformat data by both sending and
    receiving threads. The choices here are left to the user - and the kernel
    doesn't get in the way of efficiency.

    It is worth noting that you can send messages to message queues from within
    ISR context.  This helps maintain consistency, since the same APIs can be
    used to provide event-driven programming facilities throughout the whole of
    the OS.

    \subsection MESSAGEPOOL Global Message Pool

    To maintain efficiency in the messaging system (and to prevent over-allocation
    of data), a global pool of message objects is provided. The size of this
    message pool is specified in the implementation, and can be adjusted
    depending on the requirements of the target application as a compile-time
    option.

    Allocating a message from the message pool is as simple as calling the

    GlobalMessagePool::Pop() Method.

    Messages are returned back to the GlobalMessagePool::Push() method once the
    message contents are no longer required.

    One must be careful to ensure that discarded messages always are returned to
    the pool, otherwise a resource leak will occur, which may cripple the
    operating system's ability to pass data between threads.

    \subsection MESSAGEQUEUES Message Queues

    Message objects specify data with context, but do not specify where the
    messages will be sent. For this purpose we have a MessageQueue object.
    Sending an object to a message queue involves calling the  MessageQueue::Send()
    method, passing in a pointer to the Message object as an argument.

    When a message is sent to the queue, the first thread blocked on the queue
    (as a result of calling the MessageQueue Receive() method) will wake up,
    with a pointer to the Message object returned.

    It's worth noting that multiple threads can block on the same message queue,
    providing a means for multiple threads to share work in parallel.

    \subsection MAILBOXES Mailboxes

    Another form of IPC is provided by Mark3, in the form of Mailboxes and Envelopes.
    Mailboxes are similar to message queues in that they provide a synchronized
    interface by which data can be transmitted between threads.

    Where Message Queues rely on linked lists of lightweight message objects
    (containing only message code and a void* data-pointer), which are inherently
    abstract, Mailboxes use a dedicated blob of memory, which is carved up into
    fixed-size chunks called Envelopes (defined by the user), which are sent and
    received.  Unlike message queues, mailbox data is copied to and from the
    mailboxes dedicated pool.

    Mailboxes also differ in that they provide not only a blocking "receive" call,
    but also a blocking "send" call, providing the opportunity for threads to
    block on "mailbox full" as well as "mailbox empty" conditions.

    All send/receive APIs support an optional timeout parameter if the
    KERNEL_USE_TIMEOUTS option has been configured in mark3cfg.h

    \subsection ATOMICOPS Atomic Operations

    \image html Mark3_arch25.png
    \image latex Mark3_arch25.png "Atomic operations" width=10cm

    This utility class provides primatives for atomic operations - that is,
    operations that are guaranteed to execute uninterrupted.  Basic atomic
    primatives provided here include Set/Add/Delete for 8, 16, and 32-bit integer
    types, as well as an atomic test-and-set.

    \subsection DRIVERS Drivers

    \image html Mark3_arch18.png
    \image latex Mark3_arch18.png "Drivers" width=10cm

    This is the basis of the driver framework.  In the context of Mark3, drivers
    don't necessarily have to be based on physical hardware peripherals.  They
    can be used to represent algorithms (such as random number generators), files,
    or protocol stacks.  Unlike FunkOS, where driver IO is protected automatically
    by a mutex, we do not use this kind of protection - we leave it up to the
    driver implementor to do what's right in its own context.  This also frees
    up the driver to implement all sorts of other neat stuff, like sending
    messages to threads associated with the driver.  Drivers are implemented as
    character devices, with the standard array of posix-style accessor methods
    for reading, writing, and general driver control.

    A global driver list is provided as a convenient and minimal "filesystem"
    structure, in which devices can be accessed by name.

    <b>Driver Design</b>

    A device driver needs to be able to perform the following operations:

    - Initialize a peripheral
    - Start/stop a peripheral
    - Handle I/O control operations
    - Perform various read/write operations
    . 
    
    At the end of the day, that's pretty much all a device driver has to do, and
    all of the functionality that needs to be presented to the developer.

    We abstract all device drivers using a base-class which implements the
    following methods:

    - Start/Open
    - Stop/Close
    - Control
    - Read
    - Write
    . 
    
    A basic driver framework and API can thus be implemented in five function
    calls - that's it! You could even reduce that further by handling the
    initialize, start, and stop operations inside the "control" operation.

    <b>Driver API</b>

    In C++, we can implement this as a class to abstract these event handlers,
    with virtual void functions in the base class overridden by the inherited
    objects.

    To add and remove device drivers from the global table, we use the following
    methods:
    \code
        void DriverList::Add( Driver *pclDriver_ );
        void DriverList::Remove( Driver *pclDriver_ );
    \endcode
    
    DriverList::Add()/Remove() takes a single argument - the pointer to the object
    to operate on.

    Once a driver has been added to the table, drivers are opened by NAME using
    DriverList::FindByName("/dev/name"). This function returns a pointer to the
    specified driver if successful, or to a built in /dev/null device if the path
    name is invalid.  After a driver is open, that pointer is used for all other
    driver access functions.

    This abstraction is incredibly useful - any peripheral or service can be
    accessed through a consistent set of APIs, that make it easy to substitute
    implementations from one platform to another.  Portability is ensured, the
    overhead is negligible, and it emphasizes the reuse of both driver and
    application code as separate entities.

    Consider a system with drivers for I2C, SPI, and UART peripherals - under
    our driver framework, an application can initialize these peripherals and
    write a greeting to each using the same simple API functions for all drivers:

    \code{.cpp}
        pclI2C  = DriverList::FindByName("/dev/i2c");
        pclUART = DriverList::FindByName("/dev/tty0");
        pclSPI  = DriverList::FindByName("/dev/spi");

        pclI2C->Write(12,"Hello World!");
        pclUART->Write(12, "Hello World!");
        pclSPI->Write(12, "Hello World!");
    \endcode

    \section KRNLPROPER Kernel Proper and Porting

    \image html Mark3_arch26.png
    \image latex Mark3_arch26.png "Kernel Proper and Porting" width=10cm

    The Kernel class is a static class with methods to handle the initialization
    and startup of the RTOS, manage errors, and provide user-hooks for fatal
    error handling (functions called when Kernel::Panic() conditions are
    encountered), or when the Idle function is run.

    Internally, Kernel::Init() calls the initialization routines for various
    kernel objects, providing a single interface by which all RTOS-related system
    initialization takes place.

    Kernel::Start() is called to begin running OS funcitonality, and does not
    return.  Control of the CPU is handed over to the scheduler, and the
    highest-priority ready thread begins execution in the RTOS environment.

    <b>Harware Abstraction Layer</b>

    Almost all of the Mark3 kernel (and middleware) is completely platform
    independent, and should compile cleanly on any platform with a modern C++
    compiler.  However, there are a few areas within Mark3 that can only be
    implemented by touching hardware directly.

    These interfaces generally cover four features:
    - Thread initializaiton and context-switching logic
    - Software interrupt control (used to generate context switches)
    - Hardware timer control (support for time-based functionlity, such as Sleep())
    - Code-execution profiling timer (not necessary to port if code-profiling is
      not compiled into the kernel)
    .

    The hardware abstraction layer in Mark3 provides a consistent interface for
    each of these four features.  Mark3 is ported to new target architectures by
    providing an implementation for all of the interfaces declared in the
    abstraction layer.  In the following section, we will explore how this was
    used to port the kernel to ARM Cortex-M0.

    <b>Real-world  Porting Example – Cortex M0</b>

    This section serves as a real-world example of how Mark3 can be ported to
    new architectures, how the Mark3 abstraction layer works, and as a practical
    reference for using the RTOS support functionality baked in modern ARM
    Cortex-M series microcontrollers.  Most of this documentation here is taken
    directly from the source code found in the /kernel/cpu/cm0/ ports directory,
    with additional annotations to explain the port in more detail.  Note that a
    familiarity with Cortex-M series parts will go a long way to understanding
    the subject matter presented, especially a basic understanding of the ARM
    CPU registers, exception models, and OS support features (PendSV, SysTick
    and SVC).  If you're unfamiliar with ARM architecture, pay attention to the
    comments more than the source itself to illustrate the concepts.

    Porting Mark3 to a new architecture consists of a few basic pieces; for
    developers familiar with the target architecture and the porting process,
    it's not a tremendously onerous endeavour to get Mark3 up-and-running
    somewhere new.  For starters, all non-portable components are completely
    isolated in the source-tree under:

    /embedded/kernel/CPU/VARIANT/TOOLCHAIN/,

    where CPU is the architecture, VARIANT is the vendor/part, and TOOLCHAIN
    is the compiler tool suite used to build the code.

    From within the specific port folder, a developer needs only implement a few
    classes and headers that define the port-specific behavior of Mark3:

    - KernelSWI (kernelswi.cpp/kernelswi.h) - Provides a maskable software-triggered
      interrupt used to perform context switching.
    - KernelTimer (kerneltimer.cpp/kerneltimer.h) - Provides either a fixed-frequency
      or programmable-interval timer, which triggers an interrupt on expiry.
      This is used for implementing round-robin scheduling, thread-sleeps, and
      generic software timers.
    - Profiler (kprofile.cpp/kprofile.h) - Contains code for runtime
      code-profiling.  This is optional and may be stubbed out if left
      unimplemented (we won't cover profiling timers here).
    - ThreadPort (threadport.cpp/threadport.h) - The meat-and-potatoes of the
      port code lives here.  This class contains architecture/part-specific code
      used to initialize threads, implement critical-sections, perform
      context-switching, and start the kernel.  Most of the time spent in this
      article focuses on the code found here.
    .

    Summarizing the above, these modules provide the following list of functionality:

        - Thread stack initialization
        - Kernel startup and first thread entry
        - Context switch and SWI
        - Kernel timers
        - Critical Sections
        .

    The implementation of each of these pieces will be analyzed in detail in the
    sections that follow.

    <b>Thread Stack Initialization</b>
   
    Before a thread can be used, its stack must first be initialized to its default
    state.  This default state ensures that when the thread is scheduled for the
    first time and its context restored, that it will cause the CPU to jump to
    the user's specified entry-point function.

    All of the platform independent thread setup is handled by the generic kernel
    code.  However, since every CPU architecture has its own register set, and
    stacks different information as part of an interrupt/exception, we have to
    implement this thread setup code for each platform we want the kernel to
    support (Combination of Architecture + Variant + Toolchain).

    In the ARM Cortex-M0 architecture, the stack frame consists of the following
    information:

    a) Exception Stack Frame

    Contains the 8 registers which the ARM Cortex-M0 CPU automatically pushes to
    the stack when entering an exception.  The following registers are included
    (in stack'd order):

    \verbatim
        [ XPSR ] <-- Highest address in context
        [ PC   ]
        [ LR   ]
        [ R12  ]
        [ R3   ]
        [ R2   ]
        [ R1   ]
        [ R0   ]
    \endverbatim

    XPSR – This is the CPU's status register. We need to set this to 0x01000000
    (the "T" bit), which indicates that the CPU is executing in “thumb” mode.
    Note that ARMv6m and ARMv7m processors only run thumb2 instructions, so an
    exception is liable to occur if this bit ever gets cleared.

    PC – Program Counter.  This should be set with the initial entry point
    (function pointer) for that the user wishes to start executing with this thread.

    LR - The base link register.  Normally, this register contains the return
    address of the calling function, which is where the CPU jumps when a function
    returns.  However, our threads generally don't return (and if they do, they're
    placed into the stop state).  As a result we can leave this as 0.

    The other registers in the stack frame are generic working registers, and have
    no special meaning, with the exception that R0 will hold the user's argument
    value passed into the entrypoint.

    b) Complimentary CPU Register Context

    \verbatim
        [ R11   ]
        ...
        [ R4    ] <-- Lowest address in context
    \endverbatim

    These are the other general-purpose CPU registers that need to be backed up/
    restored on a context switch, but aren't stacked by default on a Cortex-M0
    exception.  If there were any additional hardware registers to back up, then
    we'd also have to include them in this part of the context as well.

    As a result, these registers all need to be manually pushed to the stack on
    stack creation, and will need to be explicitly pushed and pop as part of a
    normal context switch.

    With this default exception state in mind, the following code is used to
    initialize a thread's stack for a Cortex-M0.

    \code{.cpp}
    void ThreadPort::InitStack(Thread *pclThread_)
    {
        K_ULONG *pulStack;
        K_ULONG *pulTemp;
        K_ULONG ulAddr;
        K_USHORT i;

        // Get the entrypoint for the thread
        ulAddr = (K_ULONG)(pclThread_->m_pfEntryPoint);

        // Get the top-of-stack pointer for the thread
        pulStack = (K_ULONG*)pclThread_->m_pwStackTop;

        // Initialize the stack to all FF's to aid in stack depth checking
        pulTemp = (K_ULONG*)pclThread_->m_pwStack;
        for (i = 0; i < pclThread_->m_usStackSize / sizeof(K_ULONG); i++)
        {
            pulTemp[i] = 0xFFFFFFFF;
        }

        PUSH_TO_STACK(pulStack, 0);             // Apply one word of padding

        //-- Simulated Exception Stack Frame --
        PUSH_TO_STACK(pulStack, 0x01000000);    // XSPR;set "T" bit for thumb-mode
        PUSH_TO_STACK(pulStack, ulAddr);        // PC
        PUSH_TO_STACK(pulStack, 0);             // LR
        PUSH_TO_STACK(pulStack, 0x12);
        PUSH_TO_STACK(pulStack, 0x3);
        PUSH_TO_STACK(pulStack, 0x2);
        PUSH_TO_STACK(pulStack, 0x1);
        PUSH_TO_STACK(pulStack, (K_ULONG)pclThread_->m_pvArg);    // R0 = argument

        //-- Simulated Manually-Stacked Registers --
        PUSH_TO_STACK(pulStack, 0x11);
        PUSH_TO_STACK(pulStack, 0x10);
        PUSH_TO_STACK(pulStack, 0x09);
        PUSH_TO_STACK(pulStack, 0x08);
        PUSH_TO_STACK(pulStack, 0x07);
        PUSH_TO_STACK(pulStack, 0x06);
        PUSH_TO_STACK(pulStack, 0x05);
        PUSH_TO_STACK(pulStack, 0x04);
        pulStack++;

        pclThread_->m_pwStackTop = pulStack;
    }
    \endcode
        
    <b>Kernel Startup</b>

    The same general process applies to starting the kernel on an ARM Cortex-M0
    as on other platforms.  Here, we initialize and start the platform specific
    timer and software-interrupt modules, find the first thread to run, and then
    jump to that first thread.

    Now, to perform that last step, we have two options:

    1) Simulate a return from an exception manually to start the first thread, or..
    2) Use a software interrupt to trigger the first "Context Restore/Return from
       Interrupt"

    For 1), we basically have to restore the whole stack manually, not relying
    on the CPU to do any of this for us.  That's certainly doable, but not all
    Cortex parts support this (other members of the family support privileged
    modes, etc.).  That, and the code required to do this is generally more
    complex due to all of the exception-state simulation.  So, we will opt for
    the second option instead.

    To implement a software to start our first thread, we will use the SVC
    instruction to generate an exception.  From that exception, we can then
    restore the context from our first thread, set the CPU up to use the right
    “process” stack, and return-from-exception back to our first thread.  We'll
    explore the code for that later.

    But, before we can call the SVC exception, we're going to do a couple of things.

    First, we're going to reset the default MSP stack pointer to its original
    top-of-stack value.  The rationale here is that we no longer care about the
    data on the MSP stack, since calling the SVC instruction triggers a chain of
    events from which we never return.  The MSP is also used by all
    exception-handling, so regaining a few words of stack here can be useful.
    We'll also enable all maskable exceptions at this point, since this code
    results in the kernel being started with the CPU executing the RTOS threads,
    at which point a user would expect interrupts to be enabled.

    Note, the default stack pointer location is stored at address 0x00000000 on
    all ARM Cortex M0 parts.  That explains the code below...

    \code{.cpp}
    void ThreadPort_StartFirstThread( void )
    {
        asm(
            " ldr r1, [r0] \n" // Reset the MSP to the default base address
            " msr msp, r1 \n"
            " cpsie i \n"      // Enable interrupts
            " svc 0 \n"        // Jump to SVC Call
            );
    }
    \endcode
    
    <b>First Thread Entry</b>
    
    This handler has the job of taking the first thread object's stack, and
    restoring the default state data in a way that ensures that the thread starts
    executing when returning from the call.

    We also keep in mind that there's an 8-byte offset from the beginning of the
    thread object to the location of the thread stack pointer.  This offset is a
    result of the thread object inheriting from the linked-list node class, which
    has 8-bytes of data.  This is stored first in the object, before the first
    element of the class, which is the "stack top" pointer.

    The following assembly code shows how the SVC call is implemented in Mark3
    for the purpose of starting the first thread.

    \code
    get_thread_stack:
        ; Get the stack pointer for the current thread
        ldr r0, g_pstCurrent
        ldr r1, [r0]
        add r1, #8
        ldr r2, [r1]         ; r2 contains the current stack-top

    load_manually_placed_context_r11_r8:
        ; Handle the bottom 32-bytes of the stack frame
        ; Start with r11-r8, because only r0-r7 can be used
        ; with ldmia on CM0.
        add r2, #16
        ldmia r2!, {r4-r7}
        mov r11, r7
        mov r10, r6
        mov r9, r5
        mov r8, r4

    set_psp:
        ; Since r2 is coincidentally back to where the stack pointer should be,
        ; Set the program stack pointer such that returning from the exception handler
        msr psp, r2

    load_manually_placed_context_r7_r4:
        ; Get back to the bottom of the manually stacked registers and pop.
        sub r2, #32
        ldmia r2!, {r4-r7}  ; Register r4-r11 are restored.

    set_thread_and_privilege_modes:
        ; Also modify the control register to force use of thread mode as well
        ; For CM3 forward-compatibility, also set user mode.
        mrs r0, control
        mov r1, #0x03
        orr r0, r1
        control, r0

    set_lr:
        ; Set up the link register such that on return, the code operates
        ; in thread mode using the PSP. To do this, we or 0x0D to the value stored
        ; in the lr by the exception hardware EXC_RETURN. Alternately, we could
        ; just force lr to be 0xFFFFFFFD (we know that's what we want from the
        ; hardware, anyway)
        mov  r0, #0x0D
        mov  r1, lr
        orr r0, r1

    exit_exception:
        ; Return from the exception handler.
        ; The CPU will automagically unstack R0-R3, R12, PC, LR, and xPSR
        ; for us.  If all goes well, our thread will start execution at the
        ; entrypoint, with the us-specified argument.
        bx r0
    \endcode

    On ARM Cortex parts, there's dedicated hardware that's used primarily to
    support RTOS (or RTOS-like) funcationlity.  This functionality includes the
    SysTick timer, and the PendSV Exception.  SysTick is used for a tick-based
    kernel timer, while the PendSV exception is used for performing context
    switches.  In reality, it's a "special SVC" call that's designed to be
    lower-overhead, in that it isn't mux'd with a bunch of other system or
    application functionality.

    So how do we go about actually implementing a context switch here? There are
    a lot of different parts involved, but it essentially comes down to 3 steps:

    1) Saving the context.

        Thread's top-of-stack value is stored, all registers are stacked.  We're
        good to go!

    2)  Swap threads

        We swap the Scheduler's “next” thread with the “current” thread.

    3)  Restore Context

        This is more or less identical to what we did when restoring the first
        context.  Some operations may be optimized for data already stored in
        registers.

    The code used to implement these steps on Cortex-M0 is presented below:

    \code{.cpp}
    void PendSV_Handler(void)
    {
        ASM(
        // Thread_SaveContext()
        " ldr r1, CURR_ \n"
        " ldr r1, [r1] \n "
        " mov r3, r1 \n "
        " add r3, #8 \n "

        //  Grab the psp and adjust it by 32 based on extra registers we're going
        // to be manually stacking.
        " mrs r2, psp \n "
        " sub r2, #32 \n "

        // While we're here, store the new top-of-stack value
        " str r2, [r3] \n "

        // And, while r2 is at the bottom of the stack frame, stack r7-r4
        " stmia r2!, {r4-r7} \n "

        // Stack r11-r8
        " mov r7, r11 \n "
        " mov r6, r10 \n "
        " mov r5, r9 \n "
        " mov r4, r8 \n "
        " stmia r2!, {r4-r7} \n "

        // Equivalent of Thread_Swap() - performs g_pstCurrent = g_pstNext
        " ldr r1, CURR_ \n"
        " ldr r0, NEXT_ \n"
        " ldr r0, [r0] \n"
        " str r0, [r1] \n"

        // Thread_RestoreContext()
        // Get the pointer to the next thread's stack
        " add r0, #8 \n "
        " ldr r2, [r0] \n "

        // Stack pointer is in r2, start loading registers from
        // the "manually-stacked" set
        // Start with r11-r8, since these can't be accessed directly.
        " add r2, #16 \n "
        " ldmia r2!, {r4-r7} \n "
        " mov r11, r7 \n "
        " mov r10, r6 \n "
        " mov r9, r5 \n "
        " mov r8, r4 \n "

        // After subbing R2 #16 manually, and #16 through ldmia, our PSP is where it
        // needs to be when we return from the exception handler
        " msr psp, r2 \n "

        // Pop manually-stacked R4-R7
        " sub r2, #32 \n "
        " ldmia r2!, {r4-r7} \n "

        // lr contains the proper EXC_RETURN value
        // we're done with the exception, so return back to newly-chosen thread
        " bx lr \n "
        " nop \n "

        // Must be 4-byte aligned.
        " NEXT_: .word g_pstNext \n"
        " CURR_: .word g_pstCurrent \n"
        );
    }
    \endcode
    
    <b>Kernel Timers</b>

    ARM Cortex-M series microcontrollers each contain a SysTick timer, which was
    designed to facilitate a fixed-interval RTOS timer-tick.  This timer is a
    precise 24-bit down-count timer, run at the main CPU clock frequency, that
    can be programmed to trigger an exception when the timer expires.  The
    handler for this exception can thus be used to drive software timers
    throughout the system on a fixed interval.

    Unfortunately, this hardware is extremely simple, and does not offer the
    flexibility of other timer hardware commonly implemented by MCU vendors -
    specifically a suitable timer prescalar that can be used to generate efficient,
    long-counting intervals.  As a result, while the "generic" port of Mark3 for
    Cortex-M0 leverages the common SysTick timer interface, it only supports the
    tick-based version of the kernel's timer (note that specific Cortex-M0 ports
    such as the Atmel SAMD20 do have tickless timers).

    Setting up a tick-based KernelTimer class to use the SysTick timer is,
    however, extremely easy, as is illustrated below:

    \code{.cpp}
    void KernelTimer::Start(void)
    {
        SysTick_Config(SYSTEM_FREQ / 1000); // 1KHz fixed clock...
        NVIC_EnableIRQ(SysTick_IRQn);
    }

    In this instance, the call to SysTick_Config() generates a 1kHz system-tick
    signal, and the NVIC_EnableIRQ() call ensures that a SysTick exception is
    generated for each tick.  All other functions in the Cortex version of the
    KernelTimer class are essentially stubbed out (see the source for more details).

    Note that the functions used in this call are part of the ARM Cortex
    Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (cmsis), and are supplied by all
    parts vendors selling Cortex hardware.  This greatly simplifies the design
    of our port-code, since we can be reasonably assured that these APIs will
    work the same on all devices.

    The handler code called when a SysTick exception occurs is basically the
    same as on other platforms (such as AVR), except that we explicitly clear the
    "exception pending" bit before returning.  This is implemented in the
    following code:

    \code{.cpp}
    void SysTick_Handler(void)
    {
    #if KERNEL_USE_TIMERS
        TimerScheduler::Process();
    #endif
    #if KERNEL_USE_QUANTUM
        Quantum::UpdateTimer();
    #endif

        // Clear the systick interrupt pending bit.
        SCB->ICSR |= SCB_ICSR_PENDSTCLR_Msk;
    }
    \endcode
    
    <b>Critical Sections</b>
    
    A "critical section" is a block of code whose execution cannot be interrupted
    by means of context switches or an interrupt.  In a traditional single-core
    operating system, it is typically implemented as a block of code where the
    interrupts are disabled - this is also the approach taken by Mark3.  Given
    that every CPU has its own means of disabling/enabling interrupts, the
    implementation of the critical section APIs is also non-portable.

    In the Cortex-M0 port, we implement the two critical section APIs (CS_ENTER()
    and CS_EXIT()) as function-like macros containing inline assembly.  All uses
    of these calls are called in pairs within a function and must take place at
    the same level-of-scope.  Also, as nesting may occur (critical section within
    a critical section), this must be taken into account in the code.

    In general, CS_ENTER() performs the following tasks:

        - Cache the current interrupt-enabled state within a local variable in the
        thread's state
        - Disable interrupts
        .

    Conversely, CS_EXIT() performs the following tasks:

        - Read the original interrupt-enabled state from the cached value
        - Restore interrupts to the original value
        .

    On Cortex-M series micrcontrollers, the PRIMASK special register contains a
    single status bit which can be used to enable/disable all maskable interrupts
    at once.  This register can be read directly to examine or modify its state.
    For convenience, ARMv6m provides two instructions to enable/disable interrupts
    - cpsid (disable interrupts) and cpsie (enable interrupts).  Mark3 Implements
    these steps according to the following code:

    \code{.cpp}
    //------------------------------------------------------------------------
    //! Enter critical section (copy current PRIMASK register value, disable interrupts)
    #define CS_ENTER()    \
    {    \
        K_ULONG __ulRegState;    \
        asm    ( \
        " mrs r0, PRIMASK \n"    \
        " mov %[STATUS], r0 \n" \
        " cpsid i \n "    \
        : [STATUS] "=r" (__ulRegState) \
        );

    //------------------------------------------------------------------------
    //! Exit critical section (restore previous PRIMASK status register value)
    #define CS_EXIT() \
        asm    ( \
        " mov r0, %[STATUS] \n" \
        " msr primask, r0 \n"    \
        : \
        : [STATUS] "r" (__ulRegState) \
        ); \
    }
    \endcode
    
    <b>Summary</b>

    In this section we have investigated how the main non-portable areas of the
    Mark3 RTOS are implemented on a Cortex-M0 microcontroller.  Mark3 leverages
    all of the hardware blocks designed to enable RTOS functionality on ARM
    Cortex-M series microcontrollers: the SVC call provides the mechanism by
    which we start the kernel, the PendSV exception provides the necessary
    software interrupt, and the SysTick timer provides an RTOS tick. As a result,
    Mark3 is a perfect fit for these devices - and as a result of this approach,
    the same RTOS port code should work with little to no modification on all
    ARM Cortex-M parts.

    We have discussed what functionality in the RTOS is not portable, and what
    interfaces must be implemented in order to complete a fully-functional port.
    The five specific areas which are non-portable (stack initialization, kernel
    startup/entry, kernel timers, context switching, and critical sections)  have
    been discussed in detail, with the platform-specifc source provided as a
    practical reference to ARM-specific OS features, as well as Mark3's porting
    infrastructure.  From this example (and the accompanying source), it should
    be possible for an experienced developers to create a port Mark3 to other
    microcontroller targets.

    In addition to providing a complete RTOS kernel with a variety of middleware,
    tests, and example code, Mark3 also provides a robust architecture to
    efficiently build these components.  The build system – including its design
    and use, are discussed in the following sections.

    \section BLDINTRO Introduction

    As developers, we spend an awful lot of time talking about how our source
    code is written, but devote very little energy to what happens to the code
    after it's been written... aside from producing running executables.  When
    I refer to “building better software”, I'm not talking about writing code
    – I'm talking about the technologies and processes that can be applied to
    manipulate source into a variety of products, including libraries,
    applications, tests, documentation, and performance data.

    For a lot of developers – embedded or otherwise – a typical build process
    might look something like this:

    Open the IDE, load a project and click “build”.  Sometime later, check the
    output window and look to see that there aren't any red exclamation points
    to indicate build failure.  Browse to your project's output folder to collect
    your prize:  A brand new .elf file containing your new firmware!  Click on
    the arrow to give it a quick run on your dev board, test it for a few
    minutes, and make sure it seems sane.  Pass it off to the manufacturing guys
    to load it on the line, and move on.  Next!

    Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration, but not too far-fetched; and not that
    much different from standard procedure at places I've worked in the past.

    Indeed - I've come across many developers over the years who know about how
    their software gets built beyond the “black box” that turns their code from
    text to binaries with the click of the button -- and they like it that way.
    It's entirely understandable, too.  Developing from an IDE hides all those
    messy configuration details, command-line options, symbol definitions and
    environment variables that would otherwise take away from time spent actively
    churning out code.  We all want to be more productive, of course, and it
    takes time to learn to make, or anything specific to an embedded toolchain.

    And from a product delivery perspective, binaries are the ultimate work-products
    from a software team –  these are the pieces that drive the microcontrollers,
    DSPs and CPUs in an embedded system.  When its crunch time, try convincing
    management to back off on release date in order to ensure that documentation
    gets updated to reflect the as-built nature of a project.  Or fix the gaps
    in test coverage.  Or update wikis containing profiling and performance
    metrics.  You get the picture.

    But software is a living entity – it's constantly changing as it develops and
    is refined by individuals and teams.  And source code is a medium that carries
    different information across multiple channels all at once – while one channel
    contains information about building an application, another contains
    information on building libraries.  Another carriers information on testing,
    and another still provides documentation relevant to consumers of the code.
    While not as glamorous a role as the “living firmware”, these pieces of
    critical metadata are absolutely necessary as they ensure that the firmware
    products maintain a degree of quality, performance, and conformance, and
    gives a degree of confidence before formal test and release activities take
    place.

    This is especially necessary when developing for an organizations that is
    accountable for their development and documentation practices (for example,
    ISO shops), or to shareholders who expect the companies they support with
    their wallets to apply engineering rigour to their products.

    But getting the kind of flexibility required to produce these alternative
    work products form the “example IDE” is not trivial, and can be difficult to
    apply consistently from project-to-project/IDE-to-IDE.  Automating these test
    and documentation tasks should be considered mandatory if you care about
    making the most of your development hours; manually generating and updating
    documentation, tests, and profiling results wastes time that you could be
    spending solving the right kinds of problems.

    The good news, though, is that using common tools available on any modern OS,
    you can create frameworks that make these tasks for any project, on any
    toolchain providing command-line tools.  With a bit of make, shell-script,
    and python, you can automate any number of build processes in a way that
    yields consistent, reliable results that are transferrable from project to
    project.

    This is the approach taken in the Mark3 project, which integrates build,
    testing, profiling, documentation and release processes together in order to
    produce predictable, verifiable, output that can be validated against quality
    gates prior to formal testing and release.  Only code revisions that pass all
    quality gate can be released.  In the following sections, we'll explore the
    phased build approach, and how it's used by the Mark3 project.

    \section BLDOVR Mark3 Build Process Overview

    Building software is by and large a serial process, as outputs from each
    build step are required in subsequent steps.   We start from our source code,
    scripts, and makefiles, configure our environment, and use our tools to turn
    the source code from one form to another, leveraging the outputs from each
    stage in the generation of further work products – whether it be creating
    binaries, running tests, or packaging artifacts for release.

    To simplify the design and illustrate the concepts involved, we can break down
    these serial process into the following distinct phases:

    - Pre-build – Environment configuration, target selection, and header-file staging
    - Build – Compiling libraries, and building binaries for applications and tests
    - Test + Profiling -  Running unit tests, integration tests, profiling code
    - Release – Generation of documentation from source code and test results, packaging of build artifacts and headers
    .

    Each phase and associated activities are described in detail in the following subsections.

    \subsection BLDPB Pre-Build Phase:
    <b>Target Selection</b>

    Inputs: CPU Architecture, Variant, Toolchain variables
    Outputs: Environment, makefile configuration

    In this phase, we select the runtime environment and configure all
    environment-specific variables.  Specifying environment variables at this
    phase ensures that when the build scripts are run, the correct makefiles,
    libraries, binaries, and config files are used when generating outputs.
    This can also be used to ensure that common build setting are applied to all
    platform specific binaries, including optimization levels, debug symbols,
    linker files, and CPU flags.

    <b>Staging Headers</b>

    Inputs:  All files with a .h extension, located in library or binary project /public folders
    Output:  Headers copied to a common staging directory

    In this step, header files from all platform libraries are copied to a common
    staging directory referenced by the build system.

    This simplifies makefiles and build scripts, ensuring only a single include
    directory needs to be specified to gain access to all common platform libraries.
    This keeps library and application code clean, as relative paths can be
    completely avoided.  As an added benefit, these headers can later be deployed
    with the corresponding libraries to customers, giving them access to a set
    of pre-compiled libraries with APIs, but without providing the source.

    \subsection BLDBLD Build Phase
    <b>Building Libraries</b>

    Input: Source code for all common libraries, staged headers
    Output: Static libraries that can be linked against applications
    Gate: All mandatory libraries must be built successfully

    The project root directory is scanned recursively for directories containing
    makefiles.  When a makefile is found in the root of a subdirectory and a
    library tag is encountered (in Mark3, this corresponds to the declaration
    “IS_LIB=1”), the project is built using the library-specific make commands
    for the platform.  Libraries can reference other libraries implicitly, and
    include headers from the common include directory.  Since references are
    resolved when building executable binary images, the executable projects are
    responsible for including the dependent libs.

    <b>Building Binaries</b>

    Input: Source code for individual applications, precompiled libraries, staged
           headers
    Output: Executable application and test binaries
    Gate: All mandatory binaries (applications and tests) must be built successfully

    The project root directory is scanned recursively for directories containing
    makefiles.  When a makefile is found in the root of a subdirectory and a
    binary tag is encountered (in Mark3, this corresponds to the declaration
    “IS_APP=1”), the project is built using the executable-specific make commands
    for the platform.  Applications can reference all platform and toolchain
    libraries, and include headers from the common include directory.  Care must
    be taken to ensure that all library depenencies are explicitly specified in
    the application's makefile's list.

    This step will fail if necessary dependencies are not met (i.e. required
    libraries failed to build in a prior step).

    <b>Static Analysis:</b>

    Input: Source code for libraries/binaries
    Output:  Static source analysis output
    Gate: N/A

    Static analysis tools such as clang, klocwork, and lint can be run on the
    source to ensure that there are no critical or catastrophic problems (null
    pointer exceptions, variables used before initialization, incorrect argument
    usage, etc.) that wouldn't necessarily be caught at compile-time.  Since tool
    availability and configurability varies, this isn't something that is enforced
    in the Mark3 builds.  A user may opt to use clang to perform static code
    analysis on the build, however.  The part-specific makefile contains a CLANG
    environment variable for this purpose.

    Potential quality gates could be set up such that a failure during static
    analysis aborts the rest of the build.

    Test + Profiling
    Sanity Tests

    Input: Executable test binaries, CPU simulator/embedded target system
    Output: Text output indicating test pass/failure status

    \subsection BLDTESTING Test and Profile
    <b>Unit Tests</b>

    Input: Executable test binaries, CPU simulator/embedded target system
    Output: Text output indicating test pass/failure status

    <b>Code Performance Profiling</b>

    Input: Executable test binaries, CPU simulator/embedded target system
    Output: Text output containing critical code performance metrics

    <b>Code Size Profiling</b>

    Input: Precompiled static libraries and binaries
    Output: Text output containing critical code size metrics

    \subsection BLDREL Release

    \page MARK3C Mark3C - C-language API bindings for the Mark3 Kernel.

    Mark3 now includes an optional additional library with C language bindings
    for all core kernel APIs, known as Mark3C.  This library alllows applications
    to be written in C, while still enjoying all of the benefits of the
    clean, modular design of the core RTOS kernel.

    The C-language Mark3C APIs map directly to their Mark3 counterparts using
    a simple set of conventions, documented below.  As a result, explicit API
    documentation for Mark3C is not necessary, as the functions map 1-1 to their
    C++ counterparts.

    \section MARK3CAPI API Conventions

    1) Static Methods:

    \verbatim
    <ClassName>::<MethodName>()   Becomes    <ClassName>_<MethodName>()
    i.e. Kernel::Start()          Becomes    Kernel_Start()
    \endverbatim

    2) Kernel Object Methods:

    In short, any class instance is represented using an object handle, and is
    always passed into the relevant APIs as the first argument.  Further, any
    method that returns a pointer to an object in the C++ implementation now
    returns a handle to that object.

    \verbatim
    <Object>.<MethodName>(<args>) Becomes    <ClassName>_<MethoodName>(<ObjectHandle>, <args>)

    i.e. clAppThread.Start()      Becomes    Thread_Start(hAppThread)
    \endverbatim

    3) Overloaded Methods:

    a) Methods overloaded with a Timeout parameter:

    \verbatim
    <Object>.<MethodName>(<args>) Becomes    <ClassName>_Timed<MethodName>(<ObjectHandle>, <args>)

    i.e. clSemaphore.Wait(1000)   Becomes    Semaphore_Wait(hSemaphore, 1000)
    \endverbatim
    b) Methods overloaded based on number of arguments:

    \verbatim
    <Object>.<MethodName>()                   Becomes     <ClassName>_<MethodName>(<ObjectHandle>)
    <Object>.<MethodName>(<arg1>)             Becomes     <ClassName>_<MethodName>1(<ObjectHandle>, <arg1>)
    <Object>.<MethodName>(<arg1>, <arg2>)     Becomes     <ClassName>_<MethodName>2(<ObjectHandle>, <arg1>, <arg2>)

    <ClassName>::<MethodName>()               Becomes     <ClassName>_<MethodName>(<ObjectHandle>)
    <ClassName>::<MethodName>(<arg1>)         Becomes     <ClassName>_<MethodName>1(<ObjectHandle>, <arg1>)
    <ClassName>::<MethodName>(<arg1>, <arg2>) Becomes     <ClassName>_<MethodName>2(<ObjectHandle>, <arg1>, <arg2>)
    \endverbatim

    c) Methods overloaded base on parameter types:

    \verbatim
    <Object>.<MethodName>(<arg type_a>)       Becomes     <ClassName>_<MethodName><type_a>(<ObjectHandle>, <arg type a>)
    <Object>.<MethodName>(<arg type_b>)       Becomes     <ClassName>_<MethodName><type_b>(<ObjectHandle>, <arg type b>)
    <ClassName>::<MethodName>(<arg type_a>)   Becomes     <ClassName>_<MethodName><type_a>(<arg type a>)
    <ClassName>::<MethodName>(<arg type_b>)   Becomes     <ClassName>_<MethodName><type_b>(<arg type b>)
    \endverbatim

    d) Allocate-once memory allocation APIs

    \verbatim
    AutoAlloc::New<ObjectName>                Becomes      Alloc_<ObjectName>
    AutoAlloc::Allocate(uint16_t u16Size_)    Becomes      AutoAlloc(uint16_t u16Size_)
    \endverbatim

    \section MARK3CALLOC Allocating Objects

    Aside from the API name translations, the object allocation scheme is the
    major different between Mark3C and Mark3.  Instead of instantiating objects
    of the various kernel types, kernel objects must be declared using Declaration
    macros, which serve the purpose of reserving memory for the kernel object, and
    provide an opaque handle to that object memory.  This is the case for
    statically-allocated objects, and objects allocated on the stack.

    Example: Declaring a thread

    \verbatim

    #include "mark3c.h"

    // Statically-allocated
    DECLARE_THREAD(hMyThread1);
    ...

    // On stack
    int main(void)
    {
        DECLARE_THREAD(hMyThread2);
        ...
    }

    \endverbatim


    Where:

        hMyThread1 - is a handle to a statically-allocated thread
        hMyThread2 - is a handle to a thread allocated from the main stack.

    Alternatively, the AutoAlloc APIs can be used to dynamically allocate objects,
    as demonstrated in the following example.

    \verbatim

    void Allocate_Example(void)
    {
        Thread_t hMyThread = AutoAlloc_Thread();

        Thread_Init(hMyThread, awMyStack, sizeof(awMyStack), 1, MyFunction, 0);
    }

    \endverbatim

    Note that the relevant kernel-object Init() function *must* be called prior to using
    any kernel object, whether or not they have been allocated statically, or dynamically.

    \section MARK3DRV Drivers in Mark3C

    Because the Mark3 driver framework makes extensive use of inheritence and
    virtual functions in C++, it is difficult to wrap for use with C.  In addition, all
    derived drivers types would still need to have their custom interfaces wrapped with
    C-language bindings in order to be accessible from C, which is cumbersome and
    inelegant, and duplicates large portions of code.  As a result, it's probably less
    work to write a Mark3C specific driver module with a similar interface to Mark3,
    on which drivers can be ported where necessary, or implemented directly on for
    efficiency.  The APIs presented in driver3c.h provide such an interface for use
    in Mark3c.
