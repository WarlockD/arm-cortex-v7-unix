    \brief  Platform independent thread class declarations
    
    Threads are an atomic unit of execution, and each instance of the thread
    class represents an instance of a program running of the processor.
    The Thread is the fundmanetal user-facing object in the kernel - it
    is what makes multiprocessing possible from application code.
    
    In Mark3, threads each have their own context - consisting of a stack, and
    all of the registers required to multiplex a processor between multiple 
    threads.
    
    The Thread class inherits directly from the LinkListNode class to 
    facilitate efficient thread management using Double, or Double-Circular
    linked lists.
