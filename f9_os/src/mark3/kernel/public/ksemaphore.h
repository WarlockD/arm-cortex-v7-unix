     *  Initialize a semaphore before use.  Must be called before attempting
     *  post/pend operations on the object.
     *
     *  This initialization is required to configure the behavior of the
     *  semaphore with regards to the initial and maximum values held by the
     *  semaphore.  By providing access to the raw initial and maximum count
     *  elements of the semaphore, these objects are able to be used as either
     *  counting or binary semaphores.
     *
     *  To configure a semaphore object for use as a binary semaphore, set values
     *  of 0 and 1 respectively for the initial/maximum value parameters.
     *  
     *  Any other combination of values can be used to implement a counting
     *  semaphore.

     *  \param u16MaxVal_ Maximum value for the semaphore.  Must be nonzero.

     *  thread's priority, a context switch will occur and control will be
