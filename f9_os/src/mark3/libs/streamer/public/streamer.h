     * it can then populate the byte.
     *
     * This method is useful when encoding data from a raw format into a packet-based
     * format, where one byte of input may result in multiple bytes of output being generated.
     * Especially in cases where a user wants to write to a stream while a peripheral
     * reads from it to transmisit its contents asynchronously (i.e. an interrupt-driven
     * UART consuming a data packet, where the packet is being framed and consumed
     * simultaneously).
     *
     * This should be used in conjunction with the Lock method and judicious
     * use of critical sections to prevent race conditions.
     *

     * index specified.  This is used to in conjunction with Claim to safely reserve data
     * from the buffer, while preventing race conditions occurring as a result of a consumer
     * acting on the data before it is ready.
