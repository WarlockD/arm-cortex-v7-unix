 * Name: _inode_search
 *
 * Description:
 *   Find the inode associated with 'path' returning the inode references
 *   and references to its companion nodes.  This is the internal, common
 *   implementation of inode_search().
 *
 *   If a mountpoint is encountered in the search prior to encountering the
 *   terminal node, the search will terminate at the mountpoint inode.  That
 *   inode and the relative path from the mountpoint, 'relpath' will be
 *   returned.
 *
 *   If a soft link is encountered that is not the terminal node in the path,
 *   that link WILL be deferenced unconditionally.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   The caller holds the g_inode_sem semaphore
